      "Heading: Galmed Announces Allowance of New Patent for Aramchol for the Treatment of Pulmonary and Dermal Fibrosis\n",
      "Content: TEL AVIV, Israel, Sept. 26, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Galmed Pharmaceuticals Ltd. (Nasdaq: GLMD) (\"Galmed\" or the \"Company\"), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company for liver, metabolic and fibrotic diseases announced today the allowance of a Japanese patent related to treatment of pulmonary and dermal fibrosis. A similar patent was already granted in Mexico. The approval of the patent in the US and the rest of the world is pending. With this latest patent, Galmed is strengthening and extending the patent protection of its lead compound, Aramchol, until November 2037.   Previously, Galmed reported results showing significant anti-fibrotic effects of Aramchol in a pre-clinical model of lung fibrosis. Treatment with Aramchol resulted in statistically significant fibrosis improvement in a validated bleomycin model of lung fibrosis (IPF), comparable to Pirfenidone which is the gold standard treatment. Findings were seen across all important indicators for the severity of fibrosis including hydroxyproline (a marker for collagen deposition in the fibrotic tissue) P< 0.05, Ashcroft score P < 0.005, % CPA (Percentage Collagen Proportionate Area of the lung) P < 0.001, and immunohistochemistry (type I collagen and a SMA) P < 0.005 for both staining. Allen Baharaff, CEO and President of Galmed Pharmaceuticals, commented: \"Fibrosis is a common complication of chronic inflammation and can affect all organs and tissues. To date, only limited anti-fibrotic drugs are approved or are in development, most of which have restricting side effects. These patents reinforce the value of Aramchol Meglumine as a potential treatment for a wide range of unaddressed fibrotic indications beyond our initial focus of the liver and bile duct.\" About Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a severe, chronic, progressive, fibrotic interstitial disease of unknown etiology, which remains an unmet need despite approved treatments which are limited by side effects. Bleomycin, an anti-neoplastic agent that causes lung fibrosis in human patients, has been used extensively in rodent models to mimic IPF and serves as the standard agent for induction of experimental pulmonary fibrosis in animals. Bleomycin reproduces typical features of the human disease.\n",
      "Heading: Galmed Reports Significant Anti-Fibrotic Effects of Aramchol in a Lung Fibrosis Model\n",
      "Content: TEL AVIV, Israel, July 7, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Galmed Pharmaceuticals Ltd. (Nasdaq: GLMD) (\"Galmed\" or the \"Company\"), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company for liver, metabolic, fibrosis and inflammatory diseases, announced today results showing significant effects of Aramchol in pre-clinical model of both lung and gastrointestinal (GI) fibrosis. Fibrosis is a common complication of chronic inflammation and can affect all organs and tissues.  To date, only limited anti-fibrotic drugs are approved or are in development, most of which have restricting side effects. Aramchol is a partial inhibitor of SCD1 with distinctive, direct, anti-fibrotic activity demonstrated in several pre-clinical models. Treatment with Aramchol resulted in statistically significant fibrosis improvement in a validated bleomycin model of lung fibrosis (IPF), comparable to Pirfenidone which is the gold standard treatment. Findings were seen across all important indicators for the severity of fibrosis including hydroxyproline (a marker for collagen deposition in the fibrotic tissue) P< 0.05, Ashcroft score P < 0.005, % CPA (Percentage Collagen Proportionate Area of the lung) P < 0.001, and immunohistochemistry (type I collagen and a SMA) P < 0.005 for both staining. Statistically significant improvements were also demonstrated in a validated DSS model of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) induced colitis model is widely used because of its similarities with human ulcerative colitis. Clinical improvements were statistically significant at least by p value < 0.05 while in histological score (based on inflammation and colon structural changes) significance was as low as p<0.01. Aramchol was found to be the most effective compound tested. Control groups included 5-ASA and local steroids which are the gold standards for current treatment. Galmed continues to assess Aramchol's anti-fibrotic effects also in kidney and skin. \"I am excited with today's news showing that established data about the role of SCD1 in lipid metabolism and fibrosis in the liver, is being replicated in other organs. Today we show that Aramchol's effect is evident in other organs, such as lung and gastrointestinal tract and may be as substantial as the one observed in the liver. The new findings, together with the robust anti-fibrotic effects demonstrated in clinical studies of patients with NASH and advanced fibrosis could potentially enable Galmed to quickly transition to Phase 2/3 clinical studies with Aramchol in indications with unmet need and faster development pathways.\" stated Allen Baharaff co-founder, President and CEO of Galmed.\" About Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a severe, chronic, progressive, fibrotic interstitial disease of unknown etiology, which remains an unmet need despite approved treatments which are limited by side effects.

      "Heading: Galmed Pharmaceuticals Randomizes 120th Patient in the ARREST Trial\n",
      "Content: TEL AVIV, Israel, June 1, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Galmed Pharmaceuticals Ltd. (Nasdaq: GLMD) (\"Galmed\" or the \"Company\"), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of a once-daily, oral therapy for the treatment of liver diseases, today announced that it had randomized half of the patients (N=120) in the ARREST Study. \"We are delighted to be able to announce the recruitment of 120 randomized patients ahead of our guidance. We believe our in-house clinical operations are a core competency of Galmed and has demonstrated our efficiency,\" stated Mr. Baharaff, Galmed's President and Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Baharaff continued \"I am grateful to Mr. George Tonelli, Galmed's Vice President, Clinical Operations who leads a dedicated clinical team which manages and monitors approximately 50 clinical sites in the United States, Europe, Israel and LatAm.  I would like to personally thank each member of our clinical team for their tremendous efforts and support in helping us reach our goals.\" Mr. Baharaff added \"Timely execution is of paramount importance at Galmed, especially with regard to the pace of randomization in the ARREST Study.  Going forward, we remain committed to delivering on our expectation to reach full recruitment in the Arrest Trial during the fourth quarter, 2016.\" About Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease and Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis:Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common cause of chronic liver disease in the United States and it affects almost 30% of adults in Western countries. With climbing obesity rates and more sedentary patient populations, the prevalence of NAFLD is increasing worldwide and is becoming the predominant cause of chronic liver disease in parts of the world. NAFLD represents a spectrum of diseases ranging from simple excess liver fat, or steatosis, to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). NASH is the progressive form of fatty liver disease that can lead to cardiovascular disease, cirrhosis and liver-related mortality in persons who drink little or no alcohol. NASH represents the more severe end of this spectrum and is characterized by steatosis, ballooning degeneration and lobular inflammation with or without fibrosis. Long-term risks of NASH include cardiovascular disease, cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma and end stage liver disease requiring liver transplantation.\n",
      "Heading: Galmed Pharmaceuticals Completes Two Chronic Toxicology Studies and Reports No Significant Adverse Events\n",
      "Content: TEL-AVIV, Israel, Sept. 2, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- Galmed Pharmaceuticals Ltd. (Nasdaq: GLMD) (\"Galmed\"), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of a once-daily, oral therapy for the treatment of liver diseases and cholesterol gallstones, announced today that it successfully completed two six-month chronic toxicology studies of its drug candidate, aramchol. These studies were performed in compliance with the European Medicines Agency's ICH M3 (R2) guidelines by WIL Research, a global contract research organization, at its facility in Holland. The studies are required in advance of the commencement of human clinical trials and marketing authorization for pharmaceuticals in Europe and support Galmed's planned Phase IIb clinical trial of aramchol for the treatment of Non-Alcoholic Steato-Hepatitis, or NASH, in patients who also suffer from obesity and insulin resistance, which Galmed intends to initiate in the European Union, Israel and Latin America later this year.  Galmed is continuing these two toxicology studies for an additional three months to satisfy an initial requirement of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to complete nine-month pre-clinical toxicology studies of aramchol prior to conducting clinical trials in the United States. In a six-month toxicology study in rats, testing a maximum aramchol dose of 1,000 mg/kg per day, WIL Research did not observe any treatment-related mortalities or effects on body weight. In addition, WIL Research did not observe any significant adverse events in the ophthalmologic, hematologic and biochemical testing or in macroscopic and microscopic organ examinations conducted during the study. In a concurrent six-month toxicology study in dogs, testing a maximum aramchol dose of 1,500 mg/kg per day, WIL Research likewise did not observe any treatment-related mortalities or effects on body weight, and did not observe any significant adverse events in the ophthalmologic, hematologic and biochemical testing or in the macroscopic organ examination conducted during the study. However, unlike the study in rats, blood tests revealed a decrease in total blood cholesterol levels, including low-density lipoprotein, or LDL, high-density lipoprotein, or HDL, and phospholipids, and there was a slight increase in the size of the adrenal glands of the dogs, which WIL Research assessed as a physiologic compensatory response to the decrease in blood cholesterol levels. WIL Research did not consider the decrease in blood cholesterol levels or the physiologic response of the adrenal glands as a toxic effect, but rather as a pharmacodynamic effect, which is a biochemical and physiological effect of the drug on the body. No maximum tolerated doses were reached in the studies. Galmed's Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Maya Halperin stated, \"We are pleased to have additional data supporting the favorable safety profile of aramchol as observed in these long-term, high dose animal toxicology studies. The decrease of blood cholesterol levels in dogs further supports our understanding of the positive effect of aramchol on lipids as Galmed previously observed in its preclinical studies in other species.\"\n",
      "Heading: Aramchol™ Demonstrates Significant Anti-Fibrotic Effect in a Pre-clinical Model of Fatty Liver Disease\n",
      "Content: TEL AVIV, Israel, March 30, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Galmed Pharmaceuticals Ltd. (Nasdaq: GLMD) (\"Galmed\" or the \"Company\"), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of a once-daily, oral therapy for the treatment of liver diseases, announced today pre-clinical data demonstrating significant anti-fibrotic activity of AramcholTM in methionine and choline deficient (MCD) diet in mice. The new pre-clinical studies demonstrated both a statistically significant reduction of inflammation (65% decrease in F4/80, and 80% decrease in CD64), as well as a statically significant effect on liver fibrosis (70% decrease in Sirius Red).  The repeated studies were performed by CIC bioGUNE in Spain under the supervision of Professor José Mato, a notable NASH pre-clinical researcher. Professor José Mato, CIC bioGUNE General Director, commented on the results of the pre-clinical studies, \"AramcholTM showed a potent effect on the hepatic accumulation of fatty acids in the MCD at the high dose (5 mg/kg/day) and much less at the low dose (1 mg/kg/day).\"  Professor Mato continued, \"This data support the operating hypothesis that, at least in this model, AramcholTM acts through two independent mechanisms:  The first is an anti-inflammatory mechanism, and the second is through improving lipid metabolism.  We are currently investigating transcriptomics and metabolomics data from this study, which may give new insights into the mechanisms that lead to this anti-fibrotic effect of AramcholTM.\" Professor Scott Friedman, Chief, Division of Liver Diseases, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York and a member of Galmed Scientific Advisory Board also commented ,\"These results reinforce the potential efficacy of AramcholTM in human NASH, but continued pre-clinical evaluation, use of new models, and elucidation of mechanisms-of-action remain ongoing priorities while we seek to establish AramcholTM's efficacy in clinical trials in patients with NASH.\" \"The reason that we believe these new findings are material, incremental and noteworthy is because we had previously understood that AramcholTM's primary clinical objective was to treat NASH through its ability to reduce excess liver fat (steatosis), which is commonly understood to be the underlying cause of the disease,\" stated Galmed's President and Chief Executive Officer, Allen Baharaff.  \"This new data,\" Mr. Baharaff concluded, \"suggests that AramcholTM has, in addition, a direct, significant effect against hepatic fibrosis and inflammation, which are crucial for liver regeneration.\" Full data regarding this pre-clinical research will be submitted to the 2016 AASLD Liver Meeting in Boston. About Methionine and Choline Deficiency (MCD) Mouse Model:Feeding mice a methionine and choline deficient (MCD) diet constitutes a commonly used nutritional model of NASH that induces aminotransferase elevation and changes in hepatic histological features characterized by steatosis, local inflammation, hepatocyte necrosis and fibrosis.  These changes occur rapidly and have been shown to be morphologically close to those observed in human NASH. About Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease and Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis:Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common cause of chronic liver disease in the United States and it affects almost 30% of adults in Western countries. With climbing obesity rates and more sedentary patient populations, the prevalence of NAFLD is increasing worldwide and is becoming the predominant cause of chronic liver disease in parts of the world. NAFLD represents a spectrum of diseases ranging from simple excess liver fat, or steatosis, to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). NASH is the progressive form of fatty liver disease that can lead to cardiovascular disease, cirrhosis and liver-related mortality in persons who drink little or no alcohol. NASH represents the more severe end of this spectrum and is characterized by steatosis, ballooning degeneration and lobular inflammation with or without fibrosis. Long-term risks of NASH include cardiovascular disease, cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma and end stage liver disease requiring liver transplantation.\n",

Aramchol's ability to modulate hepatic lipid metabolism was discovered and validated in animal models, demonstrating downregulation of the three key pathologies of NASH: steatosis, inflammation and fibrosis. The effect of Aramchol on fibrosis is mediated by downregulation of steatosis and directly on human collagen producing cells. Aramchol has been granted Fast Track designation status by the FDA for the treatment of NASH. NASH is an emerging world crisis impacting an estimated 3% to 5% of the U.S. population and an estimated 2% to 4% globally. It is the fastest growing cause of liver cancer and liver transplant in the U.S. due to the rise in obesity. NASH is the progressive form of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease that can lead to cardiovascular disease, cirrhosis and liver-related mortality.\n",

      "Heading: Galmed Pharmaceuticals Completes Patient Recruitment for ARREST Phase IIb NASH study\n",
      "Content: TEL AVIV, Israel,, Jan 9, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Galmed Pharmaceuticals Ltd. (Nasdaq: GLMD) (\"Galmed\" or the \"Company\"), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of Aramchol, a once-daily, oral therapy for the treatment of liver diseases including Non-Alcoholic Steato-Hepatitis (NASH), announced today that it has completed recruitment for its Phase IIb ARREST study (\"ARREST Study\"). The ARREST Study is a global, multi-center, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled, Phase IIb clinical trial evaluating the treatment effects and safety of Aramchol in 240 patients with biopsy proven NASH who are overweight or obese, and who are pre-diabetic or type-II-diabetic. The ARREST Study duration is 52 weeks with 12 weeks' follow-up period. Results are anticipated to be announced in Q2 2018. The ARREST Study primary endpoint, previously demonstrated in a Phase IIa study, is reduction in liver fat content measured by magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS).  The secondary histological endpoints include improvement of fibrosis, two-point improvement in NAS (NAFLD Activity Score) and resolution of NASH. The ARREST Study will also evaluate surrogate metabolic endpoints. Patients enrolled in the ARREST Study have advanced NASH with more than 60% having fibrosis in stages 2 (19%) and 3 (42%) and a mean NAS score of 5. \"ARREST is a global NASH study, operating across four continents including North America, Europe, LatAm and China. \"The design of the study took advantage of lessons learned from other large Phase II studies by enrolling a population at increased risk for disease progression.\" stated Allen Baharaff President and chief executive officer of Galmed. \"The ARREST study is the largest study to date to incorporate both MRI and histology endpoints. I expect that Aramchol will demonstrate the effects seen in pre-clinical and clinical studies on the three pathologies of NASH: steatosis, inflammation and fibrosis\", commented Professor Vlad Ratziu, the ARREST Study's global principal investigator. Professor Ratziu continued, \"The ARREST Study is a fully global outreach trial with spectacular rates of inclusion from numerous investigators. This speaks to the excitement for testing Aramchol and generating a large set of data on invasive and non-invasive assessments that will move the field of liver diseases forward, but also, more generally, to the potential of conducting large clinical trials globally which will be the key to further phase III developments\". About Aramchol and Non-alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH)Aramchol (arachidyl amido cholanoic acid) is a novel fatty acid bile acid conjugate, causing beneficial modulation of intra-hepatic lipid metabolism. Aramchol's ability to modulate hepatic lipid metabolism was discovered and validated in numerous animal species and models by leading Israeli and European research groups led by the Company's founder, the late Prof. Tuvia Gilat. Recently, anti-inflammatory and anti- fibrotic effects were observed in mice treated with Aramchol using a methionine-choline deficient (MCD) diet treatment model and rats' prevention thioacetamide (TAA) model. To date, over 400 subjects have been dosed with Aramchol in five Clinical trials, including the ARREST Study. Our Phase IIa Study with 60 nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and NASH patients demonstrated that Aramchol 300mg per day significantly reduced liver fat content after 12 weeks of treatment. The FDA granted Fast Track designation status to Aramchol for the treatment of NASH. NASH is an emerging health crisis impacting 3% to 5% of the U.S. population and 2% to 4% globally. It is the fastest growing cause of liver cancer and liver transplant in the U.S., due to the rise in obesity.  NASH is the progressive form of fatty liver disease that can lead to cardiovascular disease, cirrhosis and liver-related mortality in persons who drink little or no alcohol.\n",

About Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease and Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis: Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common cause of chronic liver disease in the United States and it affects almost 30% of adults in Western countries. With climbing obesity rates and more sedentary patient populations, the prevalence of NAFLD is increasing worldwide and is becoming the predominant cause of chronic liver disease in parts of the world. NAFLD represents a spectrum of diseases ranging from simple excess liver fat, or steatosis, to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). NASH is the progressive form of fatty liver disease that can lead to cardiovascular disease, cirrhosis and liver-related mortality in persons who drink little or no alcohol. NASH represents the more severe end of this spectrum and is characterized by steatosis, ballooning degeneration and lobular inflammation with or without fibrosis. Long-term risks of NASH include cardiovascular disease, cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma and end stage liver disease requiring liver transplantation.\n",

      "Heading: Galmed Announces Grant of New Patent for the Combination of Aramchol with Resmetirom (MGL-3196, REZDIFFRA) for the Treatment of NASH and Liver Fibrosis\n",
      "Content: TEL AVIV, Israel, March 15, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Galmed Pharmaceuticals Ltd. (Nasdaq: GLMD) (\"Galmed\" or the \"Company\"), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company for liver, metabolic and fibrotic diseases announced today the grant of a European patent related to the use of a combination of Aramchol and Resmetirom (MGL-3196, REZDIFFRA) for the treatment of NASH/MASH and liver fibrosis. The patent was granted in France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom and the approval of the patent in the United States and other countries is pending. With this latest patent, Galmed is strengthening and extending the patent protection of its lead compound, Aramchol, until September 2039. Previously, Galmed reported results from the Open-Label part of its Phase 3 NASH study, which demonstrated that treatment with Aramchol 300mg BID resulted in a high rate of subjects with fibrosis improvement. https://galmedpharma.investorroom.com/2022-04-28-Galmed-reports-interim-results-from-the-Open-Label-part-of-the-ARMOR-study-with-Aramchol-showing-robust-fibrosis-improvement-across-multimodality-histological-assessment Galmed has long believed that the optimum treatment for NASH/MASH will be combination therapy. Aramchol has been shown to down-regulate the expression and activity of stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD1) in hepatic stellate cells, resulting in a direct effect on fibrogenesis. Aramchol's unique mechanism of action differs from others in its competitive landscape, positioning it to work as a potent anti-fibrotic compound alongside effective treatments in both approved and pre-approval stages. Allen Baharaff, CEO and President of Galmed Pharmaceuticals mentioned that \"this new patent for the combination of Aramchol and Resmetirom reflects the same spirit of earlier patents which were granted to Galmed by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) for the treatment for hepatic fibrosis.\" Mr. Baharaff continued \"It is clear today that NASH is a chronic condition with multiple liver pathologies. Among all pathologies, excessive liver fat, high glycemic index and fibrosis are major treatment challenges. By combining Aramchol and Resmetirom, two distinct and selective compounds with complementary mechanisms, we believe this will provide a perfect treatment for NASH.\"\n",

(Nasdaq: GLMD) (\"Galmed\" or the \"Company\"), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company for liver, metabolic and inflammatory diseases, today announced upcoming publication of a paper entitled \"Aramchol Downregulates Stearoyl CoA-Desaturase 1 (SCD1) in Hepatic Stellate Cells to Attenuate Cellular Fibrogenesis\" in the JHEP Reports. The paper is expected to be published in the JHEP Reports on January 28, 2021.  The paper summarizes a longstanding research collaboration by Prof. Scott Friedman, Chief of the Division of Liver Diseases, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York and Prof. Jose Mato of the Precision Medicine and Metabolism Laboratory, CIC bioGUNE, Spain describing for the first time the role of SCD1 in hepatic fibrogenesis and outlining the mechanism by which Aramchol exerts its anti-fibrotic effect directly by down regulation of SCD1 in hepatic stellate cells (HSCs). Data further support Aramchol's role in fibrosis reversal, including the potential antifibrotic activity in the ongoing Phase 3 ARMOR study in patients with NASH and fibrosis. \"Our findings establish a direct antifibrotic effect of Aramchol on hepatic stellate cells, the principal collagen-producing cell in liver through its inhibition of SCD1. Combined with its ability to reduce liver fat, these exciting new data establish a dual mechanism of action of Aramchol that reinforces its potential efficacy in NASH patients with fibrosis,\" said Prof. Friedman, who is also Dean for Therapeutic Discovery, Fishberg Professor of Medicine and Pharmacologic Sciences at Mount Sinai, and senior author. Prof. Friedman will be participating in the Q&A session of Galmed's KOL Symposium and Pipeline Update taking place later today at 11am Eastern time. To register for the event, please click here. About Aramchol and Non-alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH) Aramchol (arachidyl amido cholanoic acid) is a novel fatty acid bile acid conjugate, liver targeted SCD1 modulator, developed as an oral therapy for the treatment of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (\"NASH\") and fibrosis. Aramchol's ability to modulate hepatic lipid metabolism was discovered and validated in animal models, demonstrating downregulation of the three key pathologies of NASH: steatosis, inflammation and fibrosis. The effect of Aramchol on fibrosis is mediated by downregulation of steatosis and directly on human collagen producing cells. Aramchol has been granted Fast Track Designation status by the FDA for the treatment of NASH. NASH is an emerging world crisis impacting an estimated 3% to 5% of the U.S. population and an estimated 2% to 4% globally. It is the fastest growing cause of liver cancer and liver transplant in the U.S. due to the rise in obesity. NASH is the progressive form of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease that can lead to cardiovascular disease, cirrhosis and liver-related mortality.\n",

      "Heading: Galmed Reports Positive Results From Pharmacokinetic Split Dose Study of Aramchol\n",
      "Content: TEL AVIV, Israel, March 12, 2019 /PRNewswire/ --  Galmed Pharmaceuticals Ltd. (Nasdaq: GLMD) (\"Galmed\" or the \"Company\"), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of the liver targeted SCD1 modulator, Aramchol, an oral therapy for the treatment of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (\"NASH\") and fibrosis, announced today positive results from a pharmacokinetic (PK) study showing that dose splitting of Aramchol 600mg to twice daily 300mg significantly increased plasma levels.  The aim of this Phase I, open-label, two-period, randomized, crossover PK study was to assess whether dose splitting of Aramchol 600mg to twice daily 300mg will significantly increase plasma levels. 16 healthy subjects took part in two study periods. Eight subjects received each regimen in the first period and the alternate regimen in the second period. A PK profile was obtained over the dosing interval at steady state on day ten of each period. Results of the study showed that the administration of Aramchol 300 mg twice daily resulted in 24-hour plasma concentrations significantly greater than those observed with the administration of Aramchol 600 mg once daily (P<0.0001). The average plasma levels (exposure) were 53% higher and exposure was greater in all 16 subjects with the twice daily dosing. The treatment in both dosing regimens was similar in terms of safety and was well tolerated. \"As previously seen in our presentations, a dose response pattern was observed in the recently completed Phase 2b ARREST study. Aramchol 600mg resulted in higher efficacy compared to 400mg, with only a 20% elevation in plasma levels. We find a further increase of 53% highly encouraging as this implies the potential for significantly higher efficacy on both NASH resolution and fibrosis improvement,\" stated Allen Baharaff, Chief Executive Officer of Galmed. \"The results of this study were recently obtained and submitted to the FDA.  We are planning to discuss these new findings in our forthcoming end of Phase 2b meeting,\" added Mr. Baharaff.

      "Heading: Galmed Pharmaceuticals Announces FDA Clearance of IND of Aramachol™ for the Treatment of Patients with HIV-Associated Lipodystrophy and Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease\n",
      "Content: TEL AVIV, Israel, Dec. 1, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Galmed Pharmaceuticals Ltd. (Nasdaq: GLMD) (\"Galmed\" or the \"Company\"), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of a once-daily, oral therapy for the treatment of liver diseases, announced today that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has cleared Galmed's Investigational New Drug (IND) application for the ARRIVE Study (ARamcholTM for the Reversal of HIV-AssociatEd Lipodystrophy and NAFLD), a proof-of-concept clinical trial that will evaluate the safety and efficacy of AramacholTM in up to 50 patients with HIV-associated lipodystrophy and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, or NAFLD. \"In patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, liver disease is among the leading causes of death,\" stated Galmed Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Maya Halpern. Dr. Halpern continued, \"Nearly half of the HIV infected patients without viral hepatitis that undergo evaluation for unexplained liver test abnormalities are found to have NAFLD. The prevalence of NAFLD is higher in individuals with HIV infection than in the general population. To date, there are no therapies for the treatment of HIV-associated NAFLD – like NASH – and clinical trials in this area have been few.\" The ARRIVE Study is a randomized, double-blinded, allocation-concealed, placebo-controlled, proof-of-concept Phase IIa clinical trial, which is an investigator-initiated study, and will be conducted at the University of California San Diego by Professor Rohit Loomba. The study will evaluate up to 50 patients with HIV-Associated Lipodystrophy and NAFLD, with either AramcholTM at 600 mg or placebo for 12 weeks. Pre- and post-treatment MRI-measured liver fat content and total body fat via dual energy x-rayabsorptiometry (DEXA) will be compared. The primary end point of successful therapy will be an improvement in hepatic steatosis as measured by MRI. Secondary endpoints will be an improvement in total body fat, metabolic profile, and liver biochemistry. Professor Loomba and his team of collaborators, including Professor Sirlin at UCSD, have pioneered the development of MRI-based assessment of treatment response in NAFLD, and will be using advanced imaging methods to assess treatment response in patients with HIV-associated NAFLD and lipodystrophy. \"At the NAFLD Research Center, UCSD, our approach is to apply innovative clinical trial design by collaborating across disciplines to find solutions for clinical problems for patients suffering from liver diseases, and the ARRIVE Study is a prime example of this innovative team science approach as it brings together clinicians working on liver disease, MR imaging, body composition and HIV to help solve the understudied and under-appreciated issue of HIV-associated NAFLD and lipodystrophy,\" said Professor Loomba, Director, NAFLD Research Center, UCSD. \"As we've discussed, we believe the commercial potential for AramcholTM extends beyond the treatment for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, or NASH,\" stated Galmed President and Chief Executive Officer, Allen Baharaff. Mr. Baharaff continued, \"Importantly, today's announcement of a Phase IIa trial, serves two strategic purposes:  (1) It marks the first step in potentially extrapolating additional commercial value with our existing assets, and (2) it signifies the beginning of our execution of a de-risking strategy through more potential applications and end markets for our product.\" Mr. Baharaff concluded, \"The ARRIVE Study is the beginning of executing this strategy and we expect to pursue additional opportunities.\" About HIV-Associated Lipodystrophy and Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease  Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) is a major global health issue, with 35.3 million people living with the disease worldwide, 2-3 million of which are in the United States, and Western and Central Europe. While effective combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) has resulted in a major reduction in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-related mortality overall, liver disease is now the second leading cause of death in patients with HIV, accounting for nearly 7-14% of all deaths in this population. Although viral hepatitis is still the leading cause of liver related morbidity and mortality in this population, nearly half of the HIV-infected patients without viral hepatitis that undergo evaluation for unexplained liver test abnormalities are found to have NAFLD. The prevalence of NAFLD is higher in individuals with HIV infection than in the general population. In a recently conducted clinical trial at the University of California San Diego by Professor Rohit Loomba, the largest such study to-date, which compared age and sex matched patients with primary NAFLD, with patients with HIV-associated NAFLD, patients with HIV-associated NAFLD had significantly higher rates of definite steatohepatitis (63% vs. 37%, P = 0.04), and more features of liver injury, including lobular inflammation (<0.001) and acidophil bodies (<0.001). About Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease and Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis  Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common cause of chronic liver disease in the United States and it affects almost 30% of adults in Western countries. With climbing obesity rates and more sedentary patient populations, the prevalence of NAFLD is increasing worldwide and is becoming the predominant cause of chronic liver disease in parts of the world. NAFLD represents a spectrum of diseases ranging from simple excess liver fat, or steatosis, to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). NASH is the progressive form of fatty liver disease that can lead to cardiovascular disease, cirrhosis and liver-related mortality in persons who drink little or no alcohol. NASH represents the more severe end of this spectrum and is characterized by steatosis, ballooning degeneration and lobular inflammation with or without fibrosis. Long-term risks of NASH include cardiovascular disease, cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma and end stage liver disease requiring liver transplantation.\n",
      "Heading: Galmed reports interim results from the Open-Label part of the ARMOR study with Aramchol showing robust fibrosis improvement across multimodality histological assessment\n",
      "Content: - Treatment with Aramchol 300mg BID resulted in a high rate of subjects with fibrosis improvement using NASH CRN, paired ranked reading and Artificial Intelligence (AI) quantitative digital analysis. - At week 48, both paired and AI evaluations identified more subjects with fibrosis improvement (65% and 100% respectively) compared to NASH CRN scoring. TEL AVIV, Israel, April 28, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Galmed Pharmaceuticals Ltd. (NASDAQ: GLMD) (\"Galmed\" or the \"Company\"), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company for liver, metabolic and inflammatory diseases announced today interim results from the Open-Label Part of the ARMOR study showing fibrosis improvement with Aramchol using multimodality histological assessment. The Open-Label Part of the ARMOR study was designed to explore the kinetics of histological outcome measures as a function of treatment duration. Acknowledging the complexity, variability and moderate reproducibility in liver pathology reading, this part was also used to further assess different methodologies that may support and improve fibrosis scoring, in preparation for the registrational double-blind, placebo-controlled part of the study. All slides were assessed using three histopathological reading methodologies. A central pathology committee scored the biopsies according to the conventional, formal, NASH CRN scoring system (F1-F4). Since paired reading may best reflect real-world pathological assessment, the same central committee was also asked to perform a ranked assessment (improvement/worsening/stable) of paired (pre and post treatment) biopsies, scrambled and blinded to sequence. This allows identifying fibrosis improvement that may be missed by the formal scoring as well statistical quantification of change from baseline. An automated and continuous score of Fibrosis Composite Severity (FCS) was established for the same slides using FibroNest™, a quantitative Digital Pathology image analysis and artificial intelligence (AI) method. This allows identifying fibrosis improvement that may be missed by the formal scoring as well statistical quantification of change from baseline. Results of post baseline biopsies performed either at 24 weeks or at 48 weeks from 46 subjects with NASH and F1-3 that received Aramchol support the anti-fibrotic effect of Aramchol and reinforce the favorable safety profile of Aramchol.

Both paired and AI evaluations identified more subjects with fibrosis improvement, indicating greater sensitivity to detect change.  For all methods, a treatment effect was larger at 48 compared to 24 weeks. AI analysis showed mean FCS reduction was -0.62 (p=0.017) at Wk24 and -1.74 (p<0.0001) at Wk>48. Allen Baharaff, Co-founder, President and CEO of Galmed commented \"The results we are announcing today reinforce the robust anti-fibrotic effects of Aramchol observed to date. The Open-Label Part of the study continues to provide valuable information for optimization of our clinical development program.  Galmed remains in the forefront of the scientifical efforts to re-assess and improve biopsy reading methodologies, for future benefit of NASH clinical trials\". About ARMOR Study ARMOR is a Phase 3 study comprised of two-parts, an open-label part and a randomized, double-controlled, placebo part, designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Aramchol in approximately 200 sites in the U.S., Europe and Latin America. The first part, an open-label study, is designed to evaluate treatment response kinetics, pharmacokinetics and safety of twice daily administration of Aramchol 300mg in approximately 150 subjects with NASH and liver fibrosis stage 1-3 (F1 capped at 30 subjects), subjects with NASH who may or may not be overweight, and subjects with NASH who may or may not have type 2 diabetes or be pre-diabetic. Patients are randomized (1:1:1) into three groups with post-baseline liver biopsy being performed at 24 weeks, 48 weeks, or 72 weeks, respectively. The open label part is being conducted at approximately 50 selected sites in the U.S., and around the world which have been less affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The second part, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of twice daily administration of Aramchol 300 mg to support regulatory approval, with both a histology-based phase and a clinically-based phase. As currently designed, a total of 2000 subjects with NASH and liver fibrosis stage 2 and 3 who are overweight and are either pre-diabetic or have type 2 diabetes are expected to be randomized 2:1 to receive Aramchol 300mg BID or matching placebo. In the histology-based phase, we intend to treat 1000 subjects with Aramchol or matching placebo for 72 weeks until the second biopsy. The histology-based data is intended to serve as the basis for the submission of a Sub-part H marketing authorization application under regulatory provisions of accelerated/conditional approval.\n",

AramcholTM's ability to modulate hepatic lipid metabolism was discovered and validated in animal models, demonstrating down regulation of the three key pathologies of NASH; steatosis, inflammation and fibrosis. The effect of AramcholTM on fibrosis is mediated by down regulation of steatosis and directly on human collagen producing cells. AramcholTM has been granted by the FDA Fast Track designation status for the treatment of NASH. NASH is an emerging world crisis impacting an estimated 3% to 5% of the U.S. population and an estimated 2% to 4% globally. It is the fastest growing cause of liver cancer and liver transplant in the U.S. due to the rise in obesity. NASH is the progressive form of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease that can lead to cardiovascular disease, cirrhosis and liver-related mortality.\n",

      "Heading: Galmed Pharmaceuticals Initiated ARMOR, a Phase 3/4 Registrational Study of Aramchol in Subjects With NASH and Fibrosis\n",
      "Content: TEL AVIV, Israel, Sept. 26, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- Galmed Pharmaceuticals Ltd. (Nasdaq: GLMD) (\"Galmed\" or the \"Company\"), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of the liver targeted SCD1 modulator Aramchol, an oral therapy for the treatment of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (\"NASH\") and fibrosis, announced today the initiation of its Phase 3/4 ARMOR clinical study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Aramchol in subjects with NASH and fibrosis. This double-blind, placebo-controlled, global study will be conducted in approximately 185 sites in the U.S., Europe, Latin America and Asia.  The ARMOR study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of Aramchol in subjects with NASH and fibrosis stages 2-3 who are overweight or obese and have prediabetes or type 2 diabetes. A total of 2000 subjects will be randomized 2:1 to receive Aramchol 300mg BID or matching placebo. The study is designed to consist of two parts. In the first part (Histology-Based) 1200 subjects will be treated with Aramchol or matching placebo for 52 weeks. The Histology-Based data will serve as the basis for the submission of a marketing authorization application under regulatory provisions of accelerated/conditional approval. In the second part (clinically-based), all subjects will continue with the same treatment assignment until study completion to confirm clinical efficacy. The ARMOR study is designed based on the phase 2b results and FDA guidance and is powered to meet the two alternative key Histology-Based endpoints: (i) NASH resolution and no worsening of liver fibrosis, and (ii) fibrosis improvement without NASH worsening. Meeting one of these endpoints is expected to suffice for the study success of the first part. More information about the ARMOR Study may be found on ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04104321. Prof. Arun Sanyal, Principal Investigator of the study commented, \"Aramchol improves both the metabolic underpinning and lipotoxic stress driving NASH and fibrogenic drive by its effects on stellate cells.  These pleiotropic beneficial effects along with the excellent safety and tolerability profile plus the positive data from earlier Phase 2A and 2B trials provide a strong rationale to proceed to a Phase 3/4 trial.  The possibility of developing a safe, well tolerated and effective treatment of active NASH with this molecule is exciting and I look forward to participating in this trial.\" Prof. Vlad Ratziu, Principal Investigator of the study commented, \"I share the excitement of having a strong drug candidate, with such good benefit/risk ratio, moving into a global, multi-national, major, late-phase NASH trial. I also look forward to collaborating with colleagues around the world, in US and Europe but also in areas outside the western World where NASH is highly prevalent. ARREST, a truly global Phase 2b trial that recruited worldwide including in Central America and Asia, created much anticipation and interest with Aramchol and should help Galmed drive fast recruitment in a timely manner.\" \"The commencement of the ARMOR Study is a significant milestone in the development of Aramchol for NASH patients\" said Allen Baharaff, Chief Executive Officer of Galmed. \"Aramchol has a unique mode of action which has been translated to clinical efficacy targeting directly both steatosis and fibrosis with an excellent safety profile and a potential to become the backbone therapy for NASH. I am delighted that the study is underway on time placing it as one of the most advanced therapeutic candidates for NASH. We look forward to rapidly completing enrollment by Q2 of 2021 with the aim of reporting top-line results by the fourth quarter of 2022.\" Galmed previously announced results from its Phase 2b ARREST study which were subsequently presented at AASLD 2018. Efficacy and safety data from this study included notable effects on key registrational endpoints of NASH resolution and fibrosis improvement and excellent safety supporting initiation of the Phase 3/4 study. More recently, Galmed reported results from a study comparing once daily Aramchol 600 mg to twice daily 300 mg with a significant increase in exposure in the twice daily treatment arm and combined with the dose response pattern observed in prior Phase 2 studies, provides potential for additional efficacy with twice daily dosing.

(Nasdaq: GLMD) (\"Galmed\" or the \"Company\"), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company for liver, metabolic and inflammatory diseases announced today results from histology and biomarkers analyses in the ongoing Open-Label Part of the ARMOR Phase 3 study.  Galmed previously announced a substantial effect on fibrosis improvement based on histology, in the 16 first patients from the ongoing Open-Label Part of the ARMOR study. New analyses of biomarkers corroborate this effect showing statistically significant reductions in biomarkers associated with liver fibrosis including ALT, AST, Fib-4 and ProC-3. Reductions of a similar magnitude are seen in a cohort of the first 20 patients for which paired biopsy have been analyzed (Late breaker AASLD Cohort N=20) and a cohort of 50 patients for which biomarker data was analyzed (ARCON Cohort N=50) based on all available data (N=139).  Aramchol continues to show excellent safety and tolerability profile. Data support that higher dose of Aramchol could provide statistically and clinically meaningful effect on fibrosis in the upcoming double-blind placebo controlled part for submission of the ARMOR study to support an NDA under Sub-part H. Results support discussions with FDA to potentially allow a smaller and shorter double-blind placebo control histology-based part to support regulatory submission of an NDA.

Mean Baseline 47.2 ug/L. Prof. Vlad Ratziu, Professor of Hepatology, Sorbonne Université, the ARMOR study co-principal investigator commented: \"this high rate of fibrosis reversal is very encouraging particularly since it was confirmed by a very stringent pathological review that includes 3 pathologists reading slides according to a predefined protocol. Moreover, it is backed by congruent changes in fibrosis biomarkers and by a biochemical response in aminotransferases already documented in the ARREST trial.\"  Allen Baharaff, President and CEO of Galmed commented \"Aramchol's direct effect on fibrosis is translated to clinical efficacy on fibrosis improvement.  Apparently, the magnitude of the statistical and clinical effects is dose related. Once elevating the dose, we are starting to see the full potential of Aramchol to reduce liver fibrosis. We believe Aramchol at a higher dose stands out as a leading compound for the treatment of liver fibrosis.\" A late-breaking poster presentation covering liver histology data of the first 20 patients from the Open Label Part of the ARMOR study will be presented at The Liver Meeting Digital Experience™ 2021, the Annual Meeting of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD), which will be held from November 12-15, 2021.

We are also collaborating with the Hebrew University in the development of Amilo-5MER, a 5 amino acid synthetic peptide. About ARMOR Study ARMOR is a Phase 3 study comprised of two-parts, an open-label part and a randomized, double-blind controlled, placebo part, designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Aramchol in approximately 200 sites in the U.S., Europe and Latin America. The first part, an open-label study, is designed to evaluate treatment response kinetics, pharmacokinetics and safety of twice daily administration of Aramchol 300mg in approximately 150 subjects with NASH and liver fibrosis stage 1-3 (F1 capped at 30 subjects), subjects with NASH who may or may not be overweight, and subjects with NASH who may or may not have type 2 diabetes or be pre-diabetic. Patients are randomized (1:1:1) into three groups with post-baseline liver biopsy being performed at 24 weeks, 48 weeks, or 72 weeks, respectively. A second post-baseline liver biopsy will be conducted after one year for subjects whose post-baseline liver biopsy at week 24, 48 or 72 does not show at least one stage improvement in fibrosis. The open label part is being conducted at approximately 50 selected sites in the U.S., and around the world which have been less affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The second part, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of twice daily administration of Aramchol 300 mg to support regulatory approval, with both a histology-based phase and a clinically-based phase. As currently designed, a total of 2000 subjects with NASH and liver fibrosis stage 2 and 3 who are overweight and are either pre-diabetic or have type 2 diabetes are expected to be randomized 2:1 to receive Aramchol 300mg BID or matching placebo. In the histology-based phase, we intend to treat 1000 subjects with Aramchol or matching placebo for 72 weeks until the second biopsy. The histology-based data is intended to serve as the basis for the submission of a Sub-part H marketing authorization application under regulatory provisions of accelerated/conditional approval. The primary histology-based endpoint is NASH resolution without worsening of fibrosis or fibrosis improvement without NASH worsening. In the clinically-based phase, all subjects will continue with the same treatment assignment for up to seven years until study completion to confirm clinical efficacy. We may announce end-of-study at the time when a total of 380 subjects have experienced at least one pre-specified clinical event or at five years from last subject randomization, whichever comes first. The primary clinically-based endpoint is expected to be based on clinical events including all-cause mortality, histological progression to cirrhosis, MELD score >15, and hepatic decompensation events (e.g., hepatic encephalopathy, variceal bleeding, ascites).

The second part, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of twice daily administration of Aramchol 300 mg to support regulatory approval, with both a histology-based phase and a clinically-based phase. As currently designed, a total of 2000 subjects with NASH and liver fibrosis stage 2 and 3 who are overweight and are either pre-diabetic or have type 2 diabetes are expected to be randomized 2:1 to receive Aramchol 300mg BID or matching placebo. In the histology-based phase, we intend to treat 1000 subjects with Aramchol or matching placebo for 72 weeks until the second biopsy. The histology-based data is intended to serve as the basis for the submission of a Sub-part H marketing authorization application under regulatory provisions of accelerated/conditional approval. The primary histology-based endpoint is NASH resolution without worsening of fibrosis or fibrosis improvement without NASH worsening. In the clinically-based phase, all subjects will continue with the same treatment assignment for up to seven years until study completion to confirm clinical efficacy. We may announce end-of-study at the time when a total of 380 subjects have experienced at least one pre-specified clinical event or at five years from last subject randomization, whichever comes first. The primary clinically-based endpoint is expected to be based on clinical events including all-cause mortality, histological progression to cirrhosis, MELD score >15, and hepatic decompensation events (e.g., hepatic encephalopathy, variceal bleeding, ascites).

      "Heading: Galmed's 600 mg Aramchol™ Achieved a Regulatory Approvable Endpoint Showing NASH Resolution Without Worsening of Fibrosis, in NASH Patients, in the Global Phase 2b ARREST 52-Week Study\n",
      "Content: TEL AVIV, Israel, June 12, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Conference call scheduled for 8:00 AM Eastern Time Tuesday June 12 Galmed Pharmaceuticals Ltd. (Nasdaq: GLMD) (\"Galmed\" or the \"Company\"), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of Aramchol™, an oral, once-daily, liver-targeted SCD1 modulator, for the treatment of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), announced top-line, 52-week results from the global Phase 2b ARREST study. In the ARREST study, patients underwent MRS and biopsy at baseline and week 52, which were centrally read, blinded to treatment allocation. The primary endpoint of the study was the change from baseline to end of study in liver triglycerides ratio as measured by MRS (Aramchol 600mg vs. placebo). Secondary endpoints, demonstrated through biopsy, included fibrosis improvement by at least one stage or more without worsening of NASH (defined by an increase of inflammation and or ballooning) and NASH resolution (defined by ballooning score 0 and inflammation score 0-1 at termination) without worsening of fibrosis. Other secondary endpoints included improvement (2 points or more) in NASH activity index, as measured by NAS or SAF, without worsening fibrosis and change in baseline to week 52/termination in ALT (U/L).  247 patients with biopsy-proven NASH who were overweight or obese and had pre-diabetes or type II diabetes mellitus were randomized in a ratio of 2:2:1 (600mg, 400mg and placebo). Baseline histology of enrolled patients demonstrated a population with advanced disease, with 60% having stage 2 and 3 fibrosis and 70% having NAS≥5 at baseline. Results from the study showed a statistically significant reduction in liver fat by MRS with Aramchol 400mg vs. placebo (p=0.0450) and not with 600mg (p=0.0655). Further, analysis of MRS responders defined by a reduction of ≥5% absolute change from baseline demonstrated a clinically and statistically significant effect of Aramchol 600mg vs placebo (47.0% vs. 24.4%; p=0.0279). Results for the two biopsy endpoints, which may currently constitute a primary endpoint for a Phase 3 trial to support an FDA marketing application, demonstrated the following: (i) significantly more patients treated with Aramchol 600mg vs. placebo achieved NASH resolution without worsening of fibrosis (16.7% vs. 5.0%; p=0.0514) and NASH resolution (19.2% vs. 7.5%; p=0.0462); and (ii) a higher proportion of patients showed at least one-point improvement in fibrosis score without worsening of NASH in Aramchol 600mg vs. placebo (29.5% vs. 17.5%; p=0.2110). Statistically significant reductions in live enzymes alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) were demonstrated in both Aramchol arms vs. placebo (p≤0.0002) and (p≤0.001), respectively. Secondary endpoints based on NAS and SAF activity score, ≥2 points improvement, show a higher proportion of patients with improvement in the Aramchol arms (600mg>400mg>placebo; P>0.05). At 52 weeks of treatment, Aramchol continues to show a favorable safety and tolerability profile. Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) were reported in 12.5%, 8.9% and 9.2% of patients in placebo, Aramchol 400mg and 600mg arms, respectively. No clustering of event type or atypical events for the studied population were reported in either Aramchol arms. Early terminations due to adverse events (AEs) occurred in 4.2%, 3.0% and 4.1% in placebo, Aramchol 400mg and 600mg arms, respectively.  Placebo Aramchol 400mg Aramchol 600mg MRS-Absolute change from -0.09% -3.41% -3.18% baseline in mean liver fat (1) P=0.0450 P=0.0655 MRS responders- Reduction of 24.4% 36.7% 47.0% ≥5% in absolute change from baseline (1) P=0.0878 P=0.0279 NASH resolution without 5% 7.5% 16.7% worsening of fibrosis (2) P=0.4955 P=0.0514 NASH resolution (2) 7.5% 12.5% 19.2% P=0.2237 P=0.0462 Fibrosis improvement without 17.5% 21.3% 29.5% worsening of NASH (2) P=0.8425 P=0.2110 ALT (U/L) Change from baseline (3) +11.82 -12.0 -17.3 P=0.0002 P< 0.0001 1)  Placebo N=41; 400mg N=90, 600mg N=83; Mixed Effect Model Repeat Measurement (MMRM) adjusted mean changes from baseline; p-values for comparison of active treatment arm vs. placebo.

(3)  Placebo N=47, 400mg N=100, 600mg N=98; MMRM adjusted mean changes from baseline; p-values for comparison of active treatment arm vs. placebo.  \"Some studies have shown an effect on NASH and some on fibrosis, while this study has shown an effect on both. Concomitant ALT reduction strengthens the histological findings,\" said Prof. Vlad Ratziu, M.D., Principal Investigator of the ARREST study and Professor of Hepatology, Sorbonne Université and Hospital Pitié – Salpêtrière, Paris, France. \"Aramchol 400mg is probably sufficient for fat reduction but, biologically, a higher dose is needed for achieving more stringent histological endpoints such as NASH resolution and fibrosis reversal. NASH is a chronic disease with complex comorbidities and Aramchol's favorable safety and tolerability profile support long-term treatment,\" concluded Prof. Ratziu. \"Results seen in the ARREST 52-week study are comparable to other one-year trials recently published or presented in the NASH space.  Pre-clinical studies had demonstrated that Aramchol has a unique mechanism of action that addresses both the metabolic dysfunction and fibrosis directly, and these mechanisms have been validated by findings in the ARREST study,\" said Prof. Scott Friedman M.D., Dean for Therapeutic Discovery and Chief Division of Liver Diseases, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY. \"Specifically, data from my laboratory submitted to an upcoming conference confirm by transcriptomic analysis a broad anti-fibrotic effect of Aramchol in fibrogenic hepatic stellate cells, which is complementary to the data seen in this Phase 2b, biopsy-based clinical study. In my view, these results, together with its safety and tolerability, place Aramchol among the leading frontline therapeutic candidates under investigation for NASH.\" \"These are exciting data which demonstrate that 600mg of Aramchol improves disease activity, fibrosis and progression to cirrhosis which in the long term may translate to meaningful clinical improvement,\" said Prof. Arun Sanyal, M.D., Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition Virginia Commonwealth University and Co-Chair of the Liver Forum at the Forum for Collaborative Research at the University of California, Berkeley, School of Public Health. \"Furthermore, the dose dependency of the effects and the fact it was a global study represents the clinical reality of the global NASH pandemic and provides indications that these results are likely to be reproduced in a pivotal phase 3 trial.\" \"We have previously shown that MRS and MRI have a strong correlation in assessing liver fat content. A 5% absolute reduction in liver fat on MRS is likely to be clinically significant as demonstrated here with higher rates of resolution of NASH and one-stage improvement in fibrosis and a consistently robust dose-dependent decline in serum ALT with Aramchol in the ARREST Trial,\" said Prof. Rohit Loomba, MD, MHSc, Director, NAFLD Research Center, Director of Hepatology, Professor of Medicine University of California at San Diego. \"The ARREST trial was notable in that MRS was performed in four continents for the assessment of treatment response.\" \"We are excited with the ARREST results that will enable Galmed to meet with the regulators as soon as possible and discuss the pivotal study design,\" said Allen Baharaff President and Chief Executive Officer of Galmed. \"It is extremely gratifying that Aramchol's scientific rationale for disease modification of NASH is being translated into clinical coherent results.\" Conference Call and Webcast Information Tuesday, June 12th @ 8:00am Eastern Time Within the US: 1-800-239-9838Outside the US: 1-323-794-2551 From Israel: 1809-212-883 Conference ID: 6065512 Webcast: http://public.viavid.com/index.php?id=130063.

In order to be eligible to participate, patients had to have NASH, as diagnosed by a biopsy centrally read (steatosis ≥1 + inflammation ≥1 + ballooning ≥1; total activity NAS score of 4 or more), be overweight or obese as measured by a Body Mass Index between 25 and 40 or waist circumference between 88cm to 200cm for women, and between 102cm to 200cm for men. Patients were treated for 52 weeks before undergoing the second biopsy and MRS, with a 12 weeks post treatment follow up. Blinded to treatment assignment, all entry and week 52 liver biopsies and MRS were read by a single pathologist and a single reading center, respectively.

      "Heading: Galmed Pharmaceuticals Announces the Enrollment of the First Patient in the ARRIVE Study\n",
      "Content: TEL AVIV, Israel, March 1, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Galmed Pharmaceuticals Ltd. (Nasdaq: GLMD) (\"Galmed\" or the \"Company\"), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of a once-daily, oral therapy for the treatment of liver diseases, announced today that it has randomized the first patient in the ARRIVE Study (ARamcholTM for the Reversal of HIV-AssociatEd Lipodystrophy and NAFLD), a proof-of-concept clinical trial that will evaluate the safety and efficacy of AramacholTM in up to 50 patients with HIV-associated lipodystrophy and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, or NAFLD. The ARRIVE Study is a randomized, double-blinded, allocation-concealed, placebo-controlled, proof-of-concept Phase IIa clinical trial, which is an investigator-initiated study, and is being conducted at the NAFLD Research Center, University of California San Diego by Professor Rohit Loomba. The study will evaluate up to 50 patients with HIV-Associated Lipodystrophy and NAFLD, with either AramcholTM at 600 mg or a placebo for 12 weeks. Pre- and post-treatment MRI-measured liver fat content and total body fat via dual energy x-rayabsorptiometry (DEXA) will be compared. The primary end point of successful therapy will be an improvement in hepatic steatosis as measured by MRI. Secondary endpoints will be an improvement in total body fat, metabolic profile, and liver biochemistry. Professor Loomba and his team of collaborators, including Professor Sirlin at UCSD, have pioneered the development of MRI-based assessment of treatment response in NAFLD, and will be using advanced imaging methods to assess treatment response in patients with HIV-associated NAFLD and lipodystrophy. \"At the NAFLD Research Center, UCSD, our approach is to apply innovative clinical trial design by collaborating across disciplines to find solutions for clinical problems for patients suffering from liver diseases, and the ARRIVE Study is a prime example of this innovative team science approach as it brings together clinicians working on liver disease, MR imaging, body composition and HIV to help solve the understudied and under-appreciated issue of HIV-associated NAFLD and lipodystrophy,\" said Professor Loomba, Director, NAFLD Research Center, UCSD. \"In patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, liver disease is among the leading causes of death,\" stated Galmed President and CEO, Allen Baharaff. Mr. Baharaff continued, \"Nearly half of the HIV infected patients without viral hepatitis that undergo evaluation for unexplained liver test abnormalities are found to have NAFLD. The prevalence of NAFLD is higher in individuals with HIV infection than in the general population. To date, there are no therapies for the treatment of HIV-associated NAFLD – like NASH – and clinical trials in this area have been few.\" About HIV-Associated Lipodystrophy and Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease:Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) is a major global health issue, with 35.3 million people living with the disease worldwide, 2-3 million of which are in the United States, and Western and Central Europe[1]. While effective combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) has resulted in a major reduction in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-related mortality overall, liver disease is now the second leading cause of death in patients with HIV, accounting for nearly 7-14% of all deaths in this population¹. Although viral hepatitis is still the leading cause of liver related morbidity and mortality in this population, nearly half of the HIV-infected patients without viral hepatitis that undergo evaluation for unexplained liver test abnormalities are found to have NAFLD¹. The prevalence of NAFLD is higher in individuals with HIV infection than in the general population. In a recently conducted clinical trial at the University of California San Diego by Professor Rohit Loomba, the largest such study to-date, which compared age and sex matched patients with primary NAFLD, with patients with HIV-associated NAFLD, patients with HIV-associated NAFLD had significantly higher rates of definite steatohepatitis (63% vs. 37%, P = 0.04), and more features of liver injury, including lobular inflammation (<0.001) and acidophil bodies (<0.001). More information about the ARRIVE Study may be found on ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02684591. About Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease and Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis:Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common cause of chronic liver disease in the United States and it affects almost 30% of adults in Western countries. With climbing obesity rates and more sedentary patient populations, the prevalence of NAFLD is increasing worldwide and is becoming the predominant cause of chronic liver disease in parts of the world. NAFLD represents a spectrum of diseases ranging from simple excess liver fat, or steatosis, to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). NASH is the progressive form of fatty liver disease that can lead to cardiovascular disease, cirrhosis and liver-related mortality in persons who drink little or no alcohol. NASH represents the more severe end of this spectrum and is characterized by steatosis, ballooning degeneration and lobular inflammation with or without fibrosis. Long-term risks of NASH include cardiovascular disease, cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma and end stage liver disease requiring liver transplantation.\n",

About Aramchol and Non-alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH) Aramchol (arachidyl amido cholanoic acid) is a novel fatty acid bile acid conjugate, inducing beneficial modulation of intra-hepatic lipid metabolism. Aramchol's ability to modulate hepatic lipid metabolism was discovered and validated in animal models, demonstrating downregulation of the three key pathologies of NASH: steatosis, inflammation and fibrosis. The effect of Aramchol on fibrosis is mediated by downregulation of steatosis and directly on human collagen producing cells. Aramchol has been granted Fast Track designation status by the FDA for the treatment of NASH. NASH is an emerging world crisis impacting an estimated 3% to 5% of the U.S. population and an estimated 2% to 4% globally. It is the fastest growing cause of liver cancer and liver transplant in the U.S. due to the rise in obesity. NASH is the progressive form of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease that can lead to cardiovascular disease, cirrhosis and liver-related mortality.\n",

      "Content: TEL AVIV, Israel, May 7, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- Galmed Pharmaceuticals Ltd. (Nasdaq: GLMD) (\"Galmed\" or the \"Company\"), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of the liver targeted SCD1 modulator Aramchol™, an oral therapy for the treatment of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, or NASH and fibrosis, provides today updated information on the Company's clinical development program and reports financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2019. The Company will host a conference call and webcast at 08:30 ET today. Business Update Completion of End of Phase 2 Meeting With FDA In April 2019, the Company announced that it completed its End-of-Phase 2 meeting with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and reached general agreement on key aspects of the Phase 3/4 development and registration plan for Aramchol and on the pivotal registration study ARMOR. General agreement has been reached with FDA on key aspects of the ARMOR study including patient population, study endpoints, study dose and treatment duration. Updates on the ARMOR study design The planned Phase 3/4 ARMOR study is a multi-national, multi-center, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Aramchol as compared to placebo in subjects with NASH and fibrosis. The ARMOR study will enroll subjects with pre-diabetes or type II diabetes, overweight or obese and a baseline fibrosis score of 2-3. The study is designed to consist of two parts. In the first part (histology-based) subjects will be treated with Aramchol or matching placebo for 52 weeks until the second biopsy. In the second part (clinically-based), subjects will continue with the same treatment assignment until study completion to confirm clinical efficacy. Assuming the results in the first part are positive, the Company plans to submit a marketing authorization application under regulatory provisions of accelerated/conditional approval. The ARMOR study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of Aramchol and is expected to enroll approximately 2000 patients dosed with 300mg of Aramchol twice daily or placebo in a 2:1 randomization ratio. The Company plans to perform an analysis of the primary histology-based endpoints after the first 1,200 patients complete 52 weeks of treatment. The trial is being powered to meet the two alternative key histology-based endpoints: (i) NASH resolution without worsening of liver fibrosis, and (ii) fibrosis improvement without NASH worsening. Under FDA guidance, meeting one of these endpoints is expected to suffice for the study success of the first part The Company plans on opening around 150 recruiting sites around the globe including in the U.S., Europe, Latin America and Asia. The Company is on track to submit its study protocol and other design elements of its ARMOR trial to the FDA this quarter with study commencement expected in the third quarter of 2019. Following commencement, the Company anticipates completion of randomization within 18 months and based on current timelines the Company aims to report the results of the first part of the study in the fourth quarter of 2022.

      "Heading: Galmed to add Open Label Part to ARMOR Study; First Read-out Expected in Q4 2021\n",
      "Content: TEL AVIV, Israel, Dec. 17, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- Galmed to conduct KOL event on January 26, 2021 to discuss these latest developments. Galmed Pharmaceuticals Ltd. (Nasdaq: GLMD) (\"Galmed\" or the \"Company\"), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company for liver, metabolic and inflammatory diseases announced today the addition of an open-label part to its ARMOR Phase 3 registrational study. All currently enrolled patients in both arms will be given the opportunity to transition to an active regimen of Aramchol. This is designed to evaluate treatment response kinetics, pharmacokinetics (PK) and safety of twice daily administration (BID) of Aramchol 300mg in approximately 150 subjects at various time points with the results of a second biopsy coming as early as 24 weeks after initiation of treatment. The 150 patients are expected to be comprised of both current ARMOR patients as well as new patients.   Separately, Galmed is announcing new data from a Phase 1, first in human (FIH) study that compared Aramchol meglumine to Aramchol acid. These initial results demonstrate that the new salt form of Aramchol meglumine has a plasma PK profile that is very similar to Aramchol acid. It also shows that the administration of both forms results in the same form of Aramchol in the blood, regardless of which drug product is administered. Allen Baharaff, Galmed co-founder and CEO commented \"The addition of the open-label part to our ARMOR study will give us an important early readout of twice daily Aramchol 300mg, which in a previously reported PK study significantly increased plasma levels, as well as provide us with other important data in support of the ARMOR registrational study.  Furthermore, over the last few years, Galmed has been in the process of developing a new product, Aramchol meglumine, which is a salt form of Aramchol free acid. We have now shown with our first in human PK data that Aramchol meglumine and Aramchol free acid, the drug substance that is currently being evaluated in our ARMOR Phase 3 study, circulate in the blood as Aramchol regardless of which drug product is administered. The markedly higher solubility of Aramchol meglumine results in lower variability which is a significant added benefit. By developing a salt version of Aramchol, we are able to take the important step towards gaining patent protection on the drug until 2035. We plan to submit these results along with other supportive data to the FDA and discuss with the FDA a plan to introduce Aramchol meglumine into the randomized placebo-controlled part of the ARMOR Phase 3 study. This is all part of our overall strategy to optimize our clinical development program towards a Sub-part H filing and approval.\" All subjects enrolled into the open-label part of ARMOR will receive 300mg of Aramchol BID. Patients will be randomized (1:1:1) into 3 groups  with  post-baseline liver biopsy being performed at 24 weeks, 48 weeks, or 72 weeks, respectively. The first data milestone is expected when approximately one-third of the study population (~ 50 subjects) has completed 24 weeks of treatment, followed shortly by a second data milestone after one-third of the population has completed the on-treatment liver biopsy. The new open label part will enroll a broader study population than the initial ARMOR protocol defined, including subjects with NASH and liver fibrosis stage 1-3, subjects with NASH who may or may not be overweight, and subjects with NASH who may or may not have type 2 diabetes (T2DM) or be pre-diabetic. The open label part of ARMOR will also provide information about the utility of state-of-the-art non-invasive tests (including ProC3 and ELF) and imaging that may be able to provide early predictions for histology responses to Aramchol and long-term safety data to support the planned histology-based Sub-part H submission to the FDA for regulatory approval. The open label part will be conducted in a smaller subset of the ARMOR sites; approximately 50 selected sites in the U.S., and around the world which have been less affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The Company is expecting the first of the planned 150 patients to be enrolled in the first quarter of 2021 and expects the first histology data to be reported by the fourth quarter of 2021. In light of the rapid development of the Aramchol meglumine program and due to the delays resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, randomization of new patients into the double-blind, placebo-controlled histology-based registrational part of ARMOR will be temporarily suspended as currently enrolled patients are transitioned to open label. This will allow the capture and reporting of important data from ARMOR much earlier than previously expected.  It will also help to ensure a seamless introduction of the new Aramchol meglumine into the double-blind, placebo-controlled part of ARMOR, which is expected to resume by the fourth quarter of 2021. Prof. Vlad Ratziu, Professor of Hepatology, Sorbonne Université, and Hospital Pitié Salpêtrière, Paris, France and the ARMOR study co-principal investigator commented \"the open-label part aims to help bridge the gap between current histology-based trials and future real-world practice where biomarkers will be extensively used to assess candidates for therapy and treatment response. It also addresses an important practical question which is to determine the individual dynamics of treatment response; this is expected to provide evidence-based knowledge with the prospect of optimizing the benefit of Aramchol 300mg BID and other future NASH therapies.\" About Aramchol and Non-alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH) Aramchol (arachidyl amido cholanoic acid) is a novel fatty acid bile acid conjugate, liver targeted SCD1 modulator, developed as an oral therapy for the treatment of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (\"NASH\") and fibrosis.

      "Heading: Galmed Pharmaceuticals Expands its Ongoing Phase IIb ARREST Study to China\n",
      "Content: TEL AVIV, Israel, June 7, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Galmed Pharmaceuticals Ltd. (Nasdaq: GLMD) (\"Galmed\" or the \"Company\"), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of a once-daily, oral therapy for the treatment of liver diseases, announced today that it has expanded the clinical operations of its ongoing Phase IIb ARREST study into China and has also commenced a pharmacokinetic (\"PK\") study in healthy Chinese subjects domiciled in the United States. The trial investigator in China is Professor George K.K. Lau, who serves as Co-Director of Hepatology at 302 Hospital in Beijing and Director at Humanity and Health Medical Center in Hong Kong.  Professor Lau has a distinguished research career and is recognized as an international leader in clinical trials, primarily in the field of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and other liver-related diseases.  Professor Lau has more than 500 publications in scientific journals, such as the New England Journal of Medicine, Lancet, Gastroenterology, Journal of Hepatology, Hepatology and Blood. Professor Lau commented, \"The significant, and unfortunate, growth rate in personal lifestyle decisions that give rise to NAFLD and NASH in China, and the Far East in general, are worrisome.  Over the last 5-10 years, the scientific and medical community in China and beyond have awoken to this reality and concluded that this disease represents a significant unmet need.\"  Professor Lau concluded, \"I'm enthusiastic to investigate the effect of Aramchol™ on NASH patients and its seeming ability to hit important molecular targets, and affect change, in this complex disease.\" In parallel, Galmed has also initiated a pharmacokinetic (\"PK\") study in Chinese subjects who are domiciled in the United States, entitled \"Pharmacokinetics of Single and Multiple Escalating Doses of Aramchol Administered under Fed Conditions in Healthy Chinese Volunteers.\"  The Company expects to enroll up to 64 subjects in this six-month study, consisting of two parts.  In part A, 32 subjects shall receive a single escalating dose; Part B shall enroll 32 subjects which shall receive a multiple escalating dose. Dr. Evelyn Darius will serve as the Study Investigator. If the PK profile from Part A is similar to the existing PK data in non-Chinese subjects, then the study may be stopped prior to enrolling Part B. The results of Part A of the PK study are expected to be available in August 2016. Allen Baharaff, Galmed's President and Chief Executive Officer stated, \"With an increasing obesity and diabetes epidemic in the Chinese population, in proportions similar to the Western world, we believe China is likely to experience an increasing outbreak of NASH and NAFLD patients.\" New epidemiology data recently presented at the 3rd Chinternational Hepatology Symposium (CIHS) in Beijing indicate that NAFLD could replace viral hepatitis as the leading cause of chronic liver disease in China.  Mr. Baharaff concluded, \"It's important that we are undertaking this expansion now and assuming a leadership position in this strategic market. This trial will contribute to the extension of the clinical development of Aramchol internationally and, in particular, in China, where CFDA regulations demands full clinical development before approval.\" About Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease and Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis: Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common cause of chronic liver disease in the United States and it affects almost 30% of adults in Western countries. With climbing obesity rates and more sedentary patient populations, the prevalence of NAFLD is increasing worldwide and is becoming the predominant cause of chronic liver disease in parts of the world. NAFLD represents a spectrum of diseases ranging from simple excess liver fat, or steatosis, to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). NASH is the progressive form of fatty liver disease that can lead to cardiovascular disease, cirrhosis and liver-related mortality in persons who drink little or no alcohol. NASH represents the more severe end of this spectrum and is characterized by steatosis, ballooning degeneration and lobular inflammation with or without fibrosis. Long-term risks of NASH include cardiovascular disease, cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma and end stage liver disease requiring liver transplantation.\n",
      "Heading: Mount Sinai and Galmed Pharmaceuticals to Collaborate in an Investigator Initiated Phase IIa Trial to Evaluate the Effect of AramcholTM in Combination with Vitamin D for the Treatment of Patients with Fibrotic Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease\n",
      "Content: TEL AVIV, Israel, May 3, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Galmed Pharmaceuticals Ltd. (Nasdaq: GLMD) (\"Galmed\" or the \"Company\"), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of a once-daily, oral therapy for the treatment of liver diseases, announced today that it has signed an investigator initiated clinical trial agreement with the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, entitled \"A Placebo-controlled Single-blinded Study of AramcholTM with Supplemental Vitamin D in Patients with Vitamin D Deficiency and Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) and Fibrosis\" (the \"Study\"). The Study, which is a Phase IIa trial, will be conducted under the leadership of principal investigator, Andrea Branch, PhD, Professor of Medicine in the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, United States, and an additional center in Israel. Galmed has filed a patent application for the composition of matter patent on the new combination therapy. The Study will enroll 80 patients with NAFLD and fibrosis, and is anticipated to be completed in the first half of 2018. The Study design includes four dose alternatives: (a) AramcholTM 400 mgs, (b) Vitamin D, (c) AramcholTM 400 mgs and Vitamin D in combination, and (d) Placebo, administrated for 24 weeks, followed by a 4-week follow-up period. The Study's primary endpoint is the change in liver stiffness (baseline to end of treatment), measured by Magnetic Resonance Elastography (MRE).  Secondary endpoints include changes in the intrahepatic fat content (measured by MRI and FibroScan/CAP), and other metabolic parameters. According to a recent study published in American Journal of Gastroenterology, \"[vitamin D deficiency] in humans and animal models indicate that [vitamin D deficiency] also contributes to increased oxidative stress, systemic inflammation, decreased adiponectin levels, toll-like receptor activation, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease … we have found that [vitamin D deficiency] in our NAFLD subjects was associated with a definitive diagnosis of NASH, increased lobular inflammation, more ballooning and the presence of fibrosis.\" [Nelson JE, et. al. Am J Gastroenterol 2016;doi:10.10385/ajg.2016.51]. According to Dr. Branch, \"The liver is a key regulator of lipid metabolism and frequently becomes inflamed and damaged in patients with metabolic abnormalities, including type-2 diabetes and obesity.  AramcholTM, a bile acid-fatty acid conjugate, was previously shown to decrease liver fat.  Vitamin D3 is a key regulatory hormone that reduces inflammation and improves the barrier function of the intestine, potentially protecting the liver from harmful bacterial products that would otherwise reach the liver and cause injury.  In addition to the innovative dual therapy, the trial has several more novel features: It will be open to patients with NASH and well-compensated liver cirrhosis (unlike many trials that exclude these patients), as well as to patients with less extensive liver damage, and it will not require a liver biopsy for participation.\" Dr. Branch continued, \"I am excited to be conducting this study with Galmed and with my colleagues at Mount Sinai, including Dr. Meena Bansal, the study hepatologist, Dr. Charissa Chang, an expert in the clinical management of NASH, and Drs. Sara Lewis and Bachir Taouli, who are innovators in liver imaging.  In addition to clinical endpoints, the study will provide information about the impact of AramcholTM and vitamin D3 on the intestinal flora comprising the microbiome.\" Dr. Branch concluded, \"These studies will be carried out in collaboration with Dr. Inga Peter and her research team in the Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai.\" Galmed Pharmaceuticals President and Chief Executive Officer, Allen Baharaff added, \"As we've discussed for some time, Galmed is seeking to address the treatment of NASH through a comprehensive portfolio approach, rather than a single \"shot-on-goal\"; a combination therapy, now with Vitamin D, fits perfectly into that strategy. NASH is a complex, multifactorial disease, which requires therapeutic approaches with multiple mechanisms of action.\" Mr. Baharaff concluded, \"We will continue to investigate compounds complementary to AramcholTM, including safe, FDA-approved compounds repositioned to treat fibrosis, as well as new chemical entities aiming to develop an ultimate treatment for NASH.\" About Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease and Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis:Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common cause of chronic liver disease in the United States and it affects almost 30% of adults in Western countries.

      "Heading: Galmed reports results from the Open-Label part of the ARMOR study showing improvements in histology, imaging, and biomarkers with Aramchol\n",
      "Content: TEL AVIV, Israel, Jan. 4, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Galmed Pharmaceuticals Ltd. (NASDAQ: GLMD) (\"Galmed\" or the \"Company\"), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company for liver, metabolic and inflammatory diseases reported today full results from the Open-Label Part of the ARMOR study corroborating effects of Aramchol across all efficacy parameters.  The study enrolled 157 subjects with biopsy-proven NASH randomized 1:1:1 into three groups differing in the timing of the post-baseline liver biopsy (Week 24, Week 48, and Week 72). Fifty-one (51) subjects underwent post-baseline biopsies prior to study discontinuation (28 subjects at <48 weeks and 23 subjects at ≥48 weeks). The study was designed to assess the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK) and efficacy kinetics as a function of treatment duration. Three independent pathologists and three different histopathology reading methodologies were used to assess the antifibrotic effect of Aramchol: fibrosis stage based on NASH CRN; ranked assessment (improvement/worsening/stable) of paired (pre- and post-baseline) biopsies, blinded to sequence; and an automated and continuous score of Fibrosis Composite Severity (FCS), using FibroNest™, a quantitative AI digital pathology image analysis method. Noninvasive tests (NITs) included imaging (fibroscan) and biomarkers (liver enzymes, FIB-4, Pro-C3 and ELF). Aramchol treatment resulted in a high proportion of subjects showing fibrosis improvement based on all three biopsy reading methodologies, with a larger treatment effect with longer duration of therapy. Following a treatment duration of 48 weeks or more, improvement in fibrosis was demonstrated in 39% of subjects according to NASH CRN and 61% of subjects according to ranked assessment. At Week 48 AI demonstrated fibrosis improvement in 100% of subjects when responders were defined by an absolute reduction of the FCS score >0.3, 65% when responders were defined by a relative reduction of >25%, and a statistically significant reduction from baseline in mean FCS score (p<0.0001). NASH resolution without worsening of fibrosis was demonstrated in 26.5% of subjects. Fibroscan, ALT, AST, and FIB4 were analyzed using MMRM, based on all subjects (N=154). Fibroscan results were consistent, with an improvement in fibrosis showing a mean absolute reduction from baseline to week 72 of 2.5 kPa (p<0.0001). At Week 72, ALT was reduced by 22 U/L (p<0.0001), AST was reduced by 18 U/L (p<0.0001), and FIB-4 was reduced by 0.30 (p<0.0001). Pro-C3 and ELF were analyzed for 43 subjects at week 24 showing reduction in both Pro-C3 levels (p<0.0001) and ELF (p=0.0038). The Open Label part demonstrated the good safety profile of Aramchol 300mg BID including long-term follow up. The incidence of serious adverse events (SAEs) was consistent with the population (10.4%) and early discontinuation rates due to adverse events (AEs) were low (4.5%). Prof. Vlad Ratziu, ARMOR study co-Principal investigator commented: \"The strength of the data we present today is in its internal consistency and coherence. Effects of Aramchol are demonstrated across all efficacy parameters with improvement over time. We used an extremely rigorous pathology reading methodology with three independent readers and three different morphological assessments of fibrosis, including digital pathology, all corroborating the antifibrotic activity of Aramchol\". Prof. Ratziu concluded that \"The type and magnitude of effects we see with Aramchol compared to other NASH candidates, together with its unique mechanism of action and safety, potentially position Aramchol as a leading treatment for patients with NASH\". Allen Baharaff, Co-founder, President and CEO of Galmed added \"the study answered the key questions it set up to answer: Aramchol's anti-fibrotic effects are seen across measures, a longer treatment duration improves outcomes and the safety profile of the 300mg BID dose regimen remains good. Importantly, we clearly demonstrated the challenges and opportunities of different pathology reading methodologies and are prepared to discuss with the FDA incorporating more sensitive methodologies as primary endpoints in NASH clinical studies. This can have a critical impact on the expected variability and sample size of future NASH studies. As we continue to evaluate our strategic alternatives, the advancement of Aramchol into the Double-Blind part of the ARMOR study depends on the outcome of this process and at present we do not have plans to initiate the Double-Blind part of the study\". About ARMOR Study ARMOR is a Phase 3 study comprised of two-parts, an open-label part and a randomized, double-controlled, placebo part, designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Aramchol in approximately 200 sites in the U.S., Europe and Latin America. The first part, an open-label study, was designed to evaluate treatment response kinetics, pharmacokinetics and safety of twice daily administration of Aramchol 300mg (new dosing regimen with higher exposure) in approximately 150 subjects with NASH and liver fibrosis stage 1-3 (F1 capped at 30 subjects). Patients were randomized (1:1:1) into three groups with post-baseline liver biopsy being performed at 24 weeks, 48 weeks, or 72 weeks, respectively. In May 2022, the Company concluded that the Open-Label part of the study met its objective and discontinued the Open-Label part. The second part, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Aramchol Meglumine to support regulatory approval, with both a histology-based phase and a clinically based phase. As currently designed, a total of 2000 subjects with NASH and liver fibrosis stage 2 and 3 who are overweight and are either pre-diabetic or have type 2 diabetes are expected to be randomized 2:1 to receive Aramchol Meglumine or matching placebo. In the histology-based phase, we intend to treat 1000 subjects with Aramchol or matching placebo for 72 weeks until the second biopsy. The histology-based data is intended to serve as the basis for the submission of a Sub-part H marketing authorization application under regulatory provisions of accelerated/conditional approval. Following the discontinuation of the Open-Label Part of the ARMOR Study, the Company has no current plans to initiate the Double-Blind part of the ARMOR Study, the commencement of which depends on the outcome of its evaluation of strategic alternatives.\n",

      "Heading: Galmed and MyBiotics to Collaborate in Development of Bespoke Microbiome Signature for Aramchol\n",
      "Content: TEL AVIV and REHOVOT, Israel, Nov. 9, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- Galmed Pharmaceuticals Ltd. (NASDAQ: GLMD) and MyBiotics Pharma Ltd. announced today they have entered into a research and development collaboration agreement to identify and optimize the selected microbiome repertoire associated with the response to Aramchol. The research will also focus on development of a standalone microbiome-based treatment for non alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and fibrosis.  Under the collaboration, MyBiotics will employ its proprietary SuperDonor technology in combination with its MyLiveIn computational AI and screening platforms to identify and optimize consortia of bacteria to reconstitute a NASH patient's gut flora in order to enhance Aramchol's clinical efficacy and response rate. The collaboration also aims to identify specific microbial biomarkers for Aramchol based on macrobiome data collected from Galmed's clinical studies that could serve as a biomarker for Aramchol at early stage of treatment. MyBiotics' microbiome therapeutic technology enables the design of bespoke microbial consortia profiles based on MyBiotics' unique culturing and fermentation capabilities. The microbiome therapeutic technology is a nature-derived culturing and fermentation technology which can be leveraged for single strains, consortia of strains and whole microbiome solutions, integrated with a computational AI platform. It increases the bacterial diversity which can be leveraged for product candidates, and at the same time produces bacteria which are more resistant to gastrointestinal conditions, increasing bioavailability and colonization. The microbiome therapeutic technology was validated in multiple in-vitro and in-vivo models. MyBiotics' lead product candidate for treatment of recurring clostridium difficile infection (CDI), MBX-SD-202, is expected to enter Phase I clinical trials in 2021. Prof. Scott Friedman, Dean for Therapeutic Discovery, Chief Division of Liver Diseases, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, commented, \"Galmed's strategic alliance with Mybiotics is both timely and exciting. The microbiome is a major driver of NASH that is still untapped yet offers great promise as a totally new approach to treat this challenging disease. I look forward to this relationship evolving successfully as we learn more about how to harness emerging knowledge about the microbiome in pursuit of better strategies for disease management.\" \"The collaboration, which aims to elevate the response rate of Aramchol, is part of our overall plan to maximize Aramchol clinical efficacy. This builds on our work to date that includes dosage optimization (a PK study that demonstrated 300 BID resulted in higher exposure of Aramchol by 53%), product optimization (development of Aramchol meglumine with higher solubility and lower variability) and treatment duration optimization,\" stated Allen Baharaff, co-founder and CEO of Galmed. \"Furthermore, with the growing interest around the microbiome as a novel drug modality, following the recent positive topline data from the SER-109 Phase 3 study, the combining of Galmed's proven track record in the NASH space coupled with MyBiotics novel and proprietary knowhow and core competences in the microbiome field, puts this collaboration at the forefront of the microbiome NASH therapeutic development space,\" added Mr. Baharaff. David Daboush, co-founder and CEO of MyBiotics, commented, \"The correlation of microbiome and multiple clinical conditions has been investigated and published in the last few years, particularly the correlation with NASH and fibrosis, which is well recognized. We, at MyBiotics, established our unique SuperDonor and MyLiveIn technologies that can be used for developing a possible solution for NASH and fibrosis. SuperDonor is an innovative alternative to FMT – it is safer, and able to produce 100's  treatments from a single stool sample. We are very excited to enter into this collaboration with Galmed, a leading company in the development of therapeutics for NASH, and leverage our technology and knowhow to develop products which could provide better solutions to NASH patients around the world.\" About Aramchol and Non-alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH) Aramchol (arachidyl amido cholanoic acid) is a novel fatty acid bile acid conjugate, inducing beneficial modulation of intra-hepatic lipid metabolism.

      "Content: TEL AVIV, Israel, Dec. 1, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- Galmed Pharmaceuticals Ltd. (Nasdaq: GLMD) (\"Galmed\"), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of a once-daily, oral therapy for the treatment of liver diseases and cholesterol gallstones, today announced the completion of the statistical analysis of a pharmacokinetic (PK) study of three doses, including two high doses (400 mg and 600 mg), of its drug candidate, aramchol, in 66 healthy adult male volunteers. No Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) were observed in the study. Galmed's Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Maya Halperin stated, \"The completion of the analysis adds important data to the favorable safety profile of aramchol, which we've consistently observed in our earlier clinical trials, as well as in our long-term, high dose animal toxicology studies.\"  Dr. Halperin continued, \"The study results support Galmed's decision to administer the two higher doses of aramchol in its Phase IIb clinical trial in Non-Alcoholic Steato-Hepatitis (NASH) patients, which will be conducted in Israel, Latin America and Europe, as well as its Phase IIa clinical trial in cholesterol gallstone patients, which was initiated in Israel earlier this month.\" The study was a single-site, randomized, partially double-blind, placebo-controlled study conducted in three parts. The first two parts of the study assessed PK, safety and tolerability of aramchol tablets administered in single doses of 200 mg, 400 mg and 600 mg either following a ten-hour overnight fast or a high-fat, high-calorie meal. The third part of the study assessed PK, safety and tolerability of aramchol tablets administered in the same three doses as the first two parts of the study for ten consecutive days, in each case within one hour after a light breakfast. Although no SAEs were observed, a total of 27 adverse events were observed (26 mild and one moderate). Out of the 27 adverse events, 24 were considered as unrelated to aramchol and three as possibly related (all three of which were mild). The PK data gathered by Galmed from the three parts of the study revealed that aramchol is appropriate for a once daily oral administration with food. As previously disclosed, Galmed is currently prepared to initiate its Phase IIb trial of aramchol in NASH patients as scheduled, which, if successful, may serve as a basis for Phase III pivotal trials for the treatment of NASH to be conducted in the United States and Europe.  Galmed expects to report interim results of this Phase IIb trial in the second half of 2015, and final results in the second half of 2016.\n",

Top line results from the study were released by Galmed on June 12, 2018. About Aramchol™ and Non-alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH) Aramchol™ (arachidyl amido cholanoic acid) is a novel fatty acid bile acid conjugate, inducing beneficial modulation of intra-hepatic lipid metabolism. Aramchol™'s ability to modulate hepatic lipid metabolism was discovered and validated in animal models, demonstrating down regulation of the three key pathologies of NASH; steatosis, inflammation and fibrosis. The effect of Aramchol™ on fibrosis is mediated by down regulation of steatosis and directly on human collagen producing cells. Aramchol™ has been granted by the FDA Fast Track designation status for the treatment of NASH. NASH is an emerging world crisis impacting an estimated 3% to 5% of the U.S. population and an estimated 2% to 4% globally. It is the fastest growing cause of liver cancer and liver transplant in the U.S. due to the rise in obesity. NASH is the progressive form of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease that can lead to cardiovascular disease, cirrhosis and liver-related mortality.\n",

      "Heading: Galmed Pharmaceuticals Announces Dosing of First Subject in First in Human Phase 1 Trial of Amilo-5MER\n",
      "Content: TEL AVIV, Israel, March 16, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Galmed Pharmaceuticals Ltd. (Nasdaq: GLMD) (\"Galmed\" or the \"Company\"), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company today announced the treatment of the first subject in the First-in-Human Phase I clinical trial evaluating Amilo-5MER for the treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases. Additional subjects enrollment to the study is ongoing. Amilo-5MER is an investigational first-in-class, specific, penta peptide, designed to interfere with Serum Amyloid A (SAA) polymerization and aggregation resulting in significant reduction of pro inflammatory cytokine secretion.  \"Initiating the Phase 1 trial represents an important milestone in the development of our pipeline product candidate, Amilo-5MER, for patients with chronic inflammatory diseases mainly IBD and Rheumatoid Arthritis. Based on encouraging preclinical data of Amilo-5MER, we believe Amilo-5MER, with its novel mechanism of action, has the potential to provide a significant treatment option for patients suffering from auto-immune and chronic inflammatory diseases,\" said Allen Baharaff, CEO of Galmed Pharmaceutical. \"We are excited to bring Amilo-5MER into the clinical phase and look forward to advancing our product pipeline to address additional important indications for the benefit of patients around the world.\" Amilo-5MER's Phase I trial is a three-part, single center, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled first in human study of single ascending doses (Part 1) and multiple doses (Part 2) of Amilo-5MER in young healthy male subjects and a single dose cohort in healthy elderly male and female subjects (Part 3). The study plans to enroll up to 64 healthy male and female subjects (56 young male and 8 elderly male and female). The primary objectives of the trial are to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of Amilo-5MER. \"The first subject dosed in the Amilo-5MER clinical trial marks a significant milestone toward delivering a new mechanism of action for potential medicines to treat autoimmune and chronic inflammatory diseases such as Crohn's Disease, Ulcerative Colitis, Rheumatoid Arthritis and  Multiple Sclerosis, all of which share the pro-inflammatory cytokine SAA. Other life-threatening maladies associated with SAA-induced 'cytokine storm' such as Sepsis or COVID-19 infection, may be also suppressed by Amilo5MER,\" said Prof. David Naor, Hebrew University Lautenberg Center for Immunology and Cancer Research  and the inventor of Amilo-5MER. About Amilo-5MER Amilo-5MER is a specific penta peptide, a highly potent inhibitor of chronic inflammation currently under development for IBD. In preclinical studies, Amilo-5MER demonstrated interference with SAA polymerization and aggregation resulting in significant reduction of chronic inflammation in multiple animal models. Amilo-5MER has a unique mode of action up stream to all pro inflammatory cytokine production which are currently being used and in clinical trials. Amilo-5MER down regulates multiple pro inflammatory cytokine secretion. In LPS induced inflammation in mice, the animal model for systemic inflammation, Amilo-5MER reduced IL-6, TNF a, IFN g and IL-1b levels in the serum. Elevated levels of these pro inflammatory cytokine are the hallmark of acute and chronic inflammatory conditions and are symptomatic also among COVID-19 patients.\n",

(GLMD), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of a once-daily, oral therapy for the treatment of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, or NASH and other liver diseases, today announced the publication of a paper entitled \"Role of Aramchol™ in steatohepatitis and fibrosis in mice\" in Hepatology Communications, a peer-reviewed, online open access journal. The paper summarizes the work conducted by a collaboration of key international, basic and clinical scientists, who are well known NASH experts. \"The paper reinforced the previously published effects of Aramchol on steatosis in patients,ˮ said Dr. Liat Hayardeny, Chief Scientific Officer of Galmed. Dr. Hayardeny continued, \"The data have helped us understand the mechanism by which Aramchol exerts its effect on steatosis and steato-fibrosis and identify its potential direct anti fibrotic effectsˮ. Prof. José M Mato, senior author, and director of CIC bioGUNE commented, \"We have identified two disparate consequences of Aramchol treatment that result in antisteatotic, anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic effects. Aramchol treatment improved steatohepatitis and steato-fibrosis by decreasing SCD1 and by maintaining cellular redox homeostasis. Our MCD model resembles the metabolic phenotype observed in NASH patients, which supports the potential use of Aramchol for this indication.ˮ Prof. Arun Sanyal, co-author, and Professor of Medicine and Chairman, Division of Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition at the Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) department of Internal Medicine and Chairman of the NIH NASH Clinical Research Network and the Liver Forum for NASH and fibrosis added: \"This pre-clinical study provides a strong pathophysiological rationale for the use of Aramchol. The results of the ongoing clinical trial are now eagerly awaited.ˮ \"The ongoing ARREST Phase IIb study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of two Aramchol doses versus placebo in patients with NASH. One of the key secondary endpoints is measuring the ability of Aramchol to improve fibrosis without worsening of NASH, and over 60% of the 248 enrolled patients showed advanced fibrosis at baseline biopsy,\" said Dr. Tali Gorfine, Chief Medical Officer of Galmed. Top line ARREST study data are expected to be available in Q2 2018. The company will present the preclinical data at the Liver Meeting® AASLD which will take place in Washington D.C., 20-24 October 2017.

      "Heading: FDA Agrees with Galmed's Plan to use Aramchol Meglumine in the Randomized Double-Blind Placebo-Controlled Part of the Phase 3 ARMOR study\n",
      "Content: TEL AVIV, Israel, Aug. 2, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Galmed Pharmaceuticals Ltd. (Nasdaq: GLMD) (\"Galmed\" or the \"Company\"), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company for liver, metabolic and inflammatory diseases announced today that the FDA agreed with its plan to use Aramchol meglumine (in lieu of Aramchol free acid) in its Phase 3 ARMOR study without the need to conduct additional nonclinical and clinical studies other than planned limited pharmacology studies relating to Aramchol meglumine. Aramchol meglumine is an improved compound using a salt form of Aramchol that has significantly greater water solubility than the free acid and an NCE patent protection valid until December 2034. Aramchol meglumine contains the same active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) called Aramchol. Prof. John Posner of the Centre for Pharmaceutical Medicine Research, King's College, London and Galmed Senior Advisor commented: \"Clinical pharmacology studies in healthy volunteers demonstrated that administration of Aramchol meglumine doubled the systemic exposure of Aramchol compared with that after dosing Aramchol free acid. Exposure with once daily (QD) 383mg Aramchol meglumine oral dosage corresponds to that obtained with the existing twice daily (BID) 300mg Aramchol free acid form which is currently being evaluated in the Phase 3 ARMOR study.  This allows future development of the QD regimen with a potential improvement in convenience and adherence\". Allen Baharaff, Galmed co-founder and CEO commented: \"In addition to its longer IP protection until December 2034, the transition to Aramchol meglumine will benefit our patients in two meaningful ways:  achieving the required exposure with 50% less API as well as significantly reducing our target marketing price once Aramchol is approved via the potential saving of ~50% of COGs.\" Mr. Baharaff continued \" We consider the FDA's agreement a significant validation of Galmed's consistent efforts to maximize the potential of Aramchol in developing a NASH treatment. The transition to Aramchol meglumine is the final step in our drug product optimization which started with the move to the BID Aramchol free acid regimen (with it higher exposure than the once daily regimen used in our Phase IIb study).  The data on the optimization of treatment duration and potential Non-Invasive Tests (NITs) associated with NASH and fibrosis, which will be revealed from the ongoing open label part of the ARMOR study, is aimed at de-risking our clinical development plan while increasing the probability of success of Aramchol's ARMOR registrational Study.\" About Aramchol and Non-alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH) Aramchol (arachidyl amido cholanoic acid) is a novel fatty acid bile acid conjugate, liver targeted SCD1 modulator, developed as an oral therapy for the treatment of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (\"NASH\") and fibrosis.

      "Heading: Galmed Announces Initiation of a Clinical Development Program to Evaluate Aramchol meglumine for the Treatment of Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (PSC)\n",
      "Content: The clinical research and development program will be conducted in collaboration with the Stravitz–Sanyal Institute for Liver Disease and Metabolic Health Virginia Commonwealth University. TEL AVIV, Israel, May 9, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Galmed Pharmaceuticals Ltd. (Nasdaq: GLMD) (\"Galmed\" or the \"Company\"), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company for liver, metabolic and fibrotic diseases, today announced the initiation of a new clinical program to evaluate its lead compound, Aramchol meglumine for the Treatment of Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (PSC).  PSC is a chronic cholestatic liver disease, characterized by progressive and multifocal fibrosis of the biliary system, which typically results in cirrhosis and fibrotic liver disease. It is a rare disease with no approved treatment that qualifies for the status of an orphan disease in the United States and EU; it is estimated that ~70% of the PSC patients have underlying IBD, most frequently ulcerative colitis (UC). Galmed plans to initiate a Phase 2 study in the last quarter of 2023. The single-arm, open label, proof-of-concept clinical trial will evaluate the effects of 24 weeks of treatment with Aramchol meglumine in approximately 15 patients with PSC. The study's endpoints will include the conventional relevant laboratory parameters (alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin), sophisticated imaging including liver stiffness using MR Elastography (MRE), imaging of the biliary tract using MR cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) and hepatocyte-specific contrast agents, histological fibrosis and molecular assessment as well as a range of biomarkers of disease activity and fibrosis. These endpoints are expected to provide a robust assessment of the underlying disease and the effects of Aramchol. Notably most patients in the study are expected to suffer also from UC. Building on the strong rationale and pre-clinical data supporting the use of Aramchol in IBD, the study will also assess the status of UC, inflammatory markers and patients related outcomes (PROs). The study will be conducted at the Stravitz–Sanyal Institute for Liver Disease and Metabolic Health Virginia Commonwealth University with Dr. Sayed Obaidullah Aseem as Principal Investigator. Prof. Arun Sanyal, Director, Stravitz-Sanyal Institute for Liver Disease and Metabolic Health at VCU commented \"there is a great unmet need for development of effective therapeutics for primary sclerosing cholangitis.  This proof-of-concept study should provide insights into the translatability of the strong preclinical data on the utility of Aramchol on cholestasis-related fibrosis in humans with PSC and we are excited to test this new metabolically driven therapeutic approach for PSC.\" Dr. Sayed Obaidullah Aseem commented \"Aramchol has sound scientific rationale for use in fibrotic liver diseases. We are finding additional supportive data in pre-clinical models of PSC and cholestasis. Our initial clinical study will use state of the art modalities in addition to commonly used disease markers to develop the foundation for larger trials in PSC. This is an exciting opportunity in figuring out a treatment for PSC patients who currently do not have any effective options. \" Allen Baharaff, CEO and President of Galmed Pharmaceuticals commented \"Looking at the significant anti fibrotic effects of Aramchol in the liver and the robust scientific rationale to use this compound for other fibrotic liver indications, we believe Aramchol has a promising clinical potential in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis as well as for IBD. We look forward to the first clinical data during 2024 to further guide future development of Aramchol\" About Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (PSC) PSC is a rare chronic cholestatic liver disease characterized by fibroinflammatory destruction of the intrahepatic and/or extrahepatic bile ducts, leading to bile stasis, fibrosis, and ultimately to cirrhosis, and often requires liver transplantation. PSC occurs more commonly in men and is typically diagnosed between the ages of 30 and 40. Most cases occur in association with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The etiology of PSC is poorly understood, but an increasing body of evidence supports the concept of cholangiocyte injury as a result of environmental exposure and an abnormal immune response in genetically susceptible individuals. Growing body of evidence suggests several treatment modalities mainly focusing on the inflammation aspect of this disorder, yet no effective therapy is available for halting disease progression.

Our lead compound, Aramchol™, a backbone drug candidate for the treatment of NASH and fibrosis is currently in a Phase 3 registrational study. We are also collaborating with the Hebrew University in the development of Amilo-5MER, a 5 amino acid synthetic peptide. About ARMOR Study ARMOR is a Phase 3 study comprised of two-parts, an open-label part and a randomized, double-controlled, placebo part, designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Aramchol in approximately 200 sites in the U.S., Europe and Latin America. The first part, an open-label study, is designed to evaluate treatment response kinetics, pharmacokinetics and safety of twice daily administration of Aramchol 300mg in approximately 150 subjects with NASH and liver fibrosis stage 1-3 (F1 capped at 30 subjects), subjects with NASH who may or may not be overweight, and subjects with NASH who may or may not have type 2 diabetes or be pre-diabetic. Patients are randomized (1:1:1) into three groups with post-baseline liver biopsy being performed at 24 weeks, 48 weeks, or 72 weeks, respectively. A second post-baseline liver biopsy will be conducted after one year for subjects whose post-baseline liver biopsy at week 24, 48 or 72 does not show at least one stage improvement in fibrosis. The open label part is being conducted at approximately 50 selected sites in the U.S., and around the world which have been less affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The second part, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of twice daily administration of Aramchol 300 mg to support regulatory approval, with both a histology-based phase and a clinically-based phase. As currently designed, a total of 2000 subjects with NASH and liver fibrosis stage 2 and 3 who are overweight and are either pre-diabetic or have type 2 diabetes are expected to be randomized 2:1 to receive Aramchol 300mg BID or matching placebo. In the histology-based phase, we intend to treat 1000 subjects with Aramchol or matching placebo for 72 weeks until the second biopsy. The histology-based data is intended to serve as the basis for the submission of a Sub-part H marketing authorization application under regulatory provisions of accelerated/conditional approval. The primary histology-based endpoint is NASH resolution without worsening of fibrosis or fibrosis improvement without NASH worsening. In the clinically-based phase, all subjects will continue with the same treatment assignment for up to seven years until study completion to confirm clinical efficacy. We may announce end-of-study at the time when a total of 380 subjects have experienced at least one pre-specified clinical event or at five years from last subject randomization, whichever comes first. The primary clinically-based endpoint is expected to be based on clinical events including all-cause mortality, histological progression to cirrhosis, MELD score >15, and hepatic decompensation events (e.g., hepatic encephalopathy, variceal bleeding, ascites).

With climbing obesity rates and more sedentary patient populations, the prevalence of NAFLD is increasing worldwide and is becoming the predominant cause of chronic liver disease in parts of the world. NAFLD represents a spectrum of diseases ranging from simple excess liver fat, or steatosis, to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). NASH is the progressive form of fatty liver disease that can lead to cardiovascular disease, cirrhosis and liver-related mortality in persons who drink little or no alcohol.  NASH represents the more severe end of this spectrum and is characterized by steatosis, ballooning degeneration and lobular inflammation with or without fibrosis. Long-term risks of NASH include cardiovascular disease, cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma and end stage liver disease requiring liver transplantation.\n",

The data will be presented at the International Liver Congress™ 2017, to be held from April 19 to the 23rd in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. The Company will host a conference call and webcast today to discuss the financial results and to provide an update on current developments with respect to its clinical programs for Aramchol™. \"Aramchol™'s anti-steatosis effect was previously established and translated to humans in our phase IIa study. Pre-clinical studies demonstrate Aramchol™ is targeting fibrosis via two main pathways – (1) by down regulating steatosis which is the main cause of inflammation and fibrosis; and (2) by directly down regulating collagen production. The new data suggests the potential direct effect of Aramchol™ in the treatment of liver fibrosis,\" said Mr. Allen Baharaff, Galmed's President and CEO. \"The TAA model is the best known animal model for experimental induced liver fibrosis and cirrhosis. In this model, we investigated the effect of Aramchol™ on liver fibrosis. We found that Aramchol™ significantly reduced the amount of fibrosis in comparison to a control group which received placebo. The results are significant and quite impressive,\" said Prof. Shimon Reif, Gastroenterologist and Head of Pediatric Department at Hadassah Medical Center at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Prof. Reif continued, \"The effect seen in the TAA model is due to direct effect on collagen production from stellate cells.\" \"As we previously reported on January 9, 2017, we have completed the enrolment of the ARREST Study, and 248 patients have been randomized. Top line Data is expected to be available during the second quarter of 2018.

(Nasdaq: GLMD) (\"Galmed\"), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of a once-daily, oral therapy for the treatment of liver diseases and cholesterol gallstones, announced today the beginning of enrollment in its Phase IIb clinical trial, or our ARREST Study, of aramchol in patients with Non-Alcoholic Steato-Hepatitis, or NASH, who also suffer from obesity and insulin resistance. Galmed has commenced its multinational ARREST Study of aramchol, which is expected to take place in more than 70 centers in 12 countries, including the United States.  Dr. Maya Halpern, Galmed's Chief Medical Officer, commented, \"We are pleased that Professor Vlad Ratziu, from the University Pierre et Marie Curie in Paris, an internationally acclaimed key opinion leader, is the ARREST Study's global principal investigator, and Professor Rohit Loomba, from the University of California San Diego School of Medicine, is the ARREST Study's U.S.-based principal investigator.\" Galmed's ARREST Study is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging Phase IIb clinical trial of aramchol.  The trial's primary end-point is a statistically significant reduction of liver fat content measured by Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy, or MRS, and the trial's secondary end-point is the complete resolution of NASH, as measured by two biopsies (at the beginning and at the end of the ARREST Study), and improvement of the NAFLD Activity Score (NAS), as well as an improvement in the markers of liver inflammation and various metabolic biomarkers. In addition, Galmed today announced that it has also expanded its clinical activities to include patient recruitment for the ARREST Study in the United States.  Allen Baharaff, Galmed's Chief Executive Officer, stated, \"We believe that U.S.-based patient recruitment will shorten the recruitment time for our ARREST Study, as well as improve the study's breadth and relevance.\"  Galmed currently expects to release interim results of the ARREST Study in the first half of 2016, later than originally planned, due to our revised geographic strategy of enrollment on the Study.  Galmed further reaffirmed that it expects to release top-line data by the end of 2016. Mr. Baharaff concluded, \"While the alignment and coordination of the study's geographic expansion caused a slight delay, we believe we're much better off for adding robust clinical operations in the United States and look forward to the interim results.\" About Galmed Galmed is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of a novel, once-daily, oral therapy for the treatment of liver diseases and cholesterol gallstones utilizing its proprietary first-in-class family of synthetic fatty-acid/bile-acid conjugates, or FABACs.

Financial Summary – First Quarter 2016 vs. First Quarter 2015: \"The significant increase in R&D activities and the momentum we are seeing in the ARREST Study patient recruitment pace continues to support our previously stated timelines concerning the ARREST Study,\" stated Allen Baharaff, Galmed's President and Chief Executive Officer.  \"Specifically, as previously disclosed, we are currently on track to have 120 patients enrolled by the end of the second quarter of 2016 and 240 patients by the end of the fourth quarter of 2016.\" Mr. Baharaff continued, \"Worldwide, we have now screened over 575 subjects for the ARREST Study, a 37% increase since our last public disclosure on March 22, 2016, less than 2 months ago.  As of yesterday, May 15, 2016, we had randomized 107 patients (+43% since March 22, 2016) and have another 6 subjects who are eligible to be randomized.  In addition, 81 subjects are currently within the screening process, which, again, normally takes between 6-8 weeks.\" Josh Blacher, Galmed's Chief Financial Officer, commented, \"During the first quarter 2016, our G&A expense decreased by a total of 8% quarter-over-quarter, excluding the effect of non-cash based compensation.  Additionally, the expenses associated with R&D and G&A improved from 68% R&D / 32% G&A in the fourth quarter of 2015, to 85% R&D / 15% G&A in the first quarter of 2016.  We will continue to remain vigilant about our G&A spend.\" Mr. Baharaff continued, \"We recently announced an investigator initiated clinical trial agreement with the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai for a study testing the effect of a combination of Aramchol™ with Vitamin D.  Combination therapy has been widely accepted by the scientific community as the future direction of treating NASH.  Aramchol™, with its strong safety profile and promising efficacy, together with Vitamin D, which is emerging as an anti-fibrotic agent, is the first NASH combo treatment to enter a Phase IIa study.  This innovative dual therapy is a natural expansion of our pipeline in addition to the ongoing ARREST and ARRIVE studies.\" Mr. Baharaff concluded, \"We are encouraged by the recent preclinical data announced in March demonstrating Aramchol™'s direct anti-fibrotic effect, which, together with its clinically-demonstrated effect on steatosis, provides a strong foundation for Aramchol™ development to address the full spectrum of NAFLD and NASH through a comprehensive portfolio approach, rather than a single 'shot-on-goal.\" Conference Call & Webcast: Monday, May 16, 2016, 8:30 am EDT / 5:30 am PDT Participant Dial-In Numbers: Toll-Free: +1-888-587-0615 Toll/International: +1-719-325-2323 Conference ID: 2502914 Webcast: http://galmedpharma.investorroom.com/events Replay, available until May 30, 2016 Replay Dial-In Numbers: Toll-Free: +1-877-870-5176 Toll/International: +1-858-384-5517 Passcode: 2502914\n",
      "Heading: Galmed Pharmaceuticals forms a Strategic Partnership with OnKai\n",
      "Content: TEL AVIV, Israel, May 4, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Galmed Pharmaceuticals Ltd. (GLMD) reported today the execution of a definitive agreement for a $3M equity investment in OnKai Inc., leading an investment round of $6M. The agreement provides Galmed with a minority, but a strategic stake in Onkai. Concurrently, a strategic partnership agreement is being signed to advance both companies by leveraging their complementary knowledge and experience in their respective fields. OnKai, a US-based technology company, combines public healthcare and medical innovation experience with complex process digitalization, design thinking, and software development to create an AI-powered digital platform that facilitates health equity in underserved communities across the US. The platform holds significant potential value for both the pharmaceutical and biotech industries by facilitating a new pool of potentially 80M underserved patients to participate in clinical trials. At its core, the collaboration empowers local clinics and healthcare professionals serving underserved communities to make a substantial contribution to clinical studies. This enables pharmaceutical companies to fulfill their scientific and regulatory obligations, which necessitate access to a diverse and representative patient populace. Galmed is strategically positioning itself for future clinical trials by leveraging OnKai's cutting-edge platform. Through the platform, Galmed intends to overcome the growing challenges of competitiveness in patient recruitment, improving the planning and execution of its upcoming clinical trials, resulting in more efficient trials. Through this partnership, the companies intend to facilitate faster clinical trial enrollment and provide patients with access to novel medications, such as orphan drugs, and opportunities to participate in otherwise inaccessible clinical trials as a therapeutic option. Noam Smetana, CEO of OnKai, stated: \"Galmed's investment serves as a catalyst to prepare OnKai to service the pharma industry. We fully intend to leverage Galmed's experience and knowledge to best serve clinical trials alongside the underserved population.\" Mr. Smetana continued: \"OnKai's grid and relationships with local clinics in underserved communities enable access to the minority patients that are essential to clinical trials. We see this as a win for patients as we bring innovative research and potential therapies to people who do not have access while providing a better representation of these populations in the drug development process.\" Allen Baharaff, Co-founder, President, and CEO of Galmed noted: \"The strategic collaboration with Onkai is intended to provide Galmed with a unique opportunity to take part in what we view as a much-needed disruptor in the industry and one which we believe can really make a difference.\" Allen Baharaff emphasized that \"Over time, the vision with the OnKai technology is to be able to create a portfolio of trials with multiple partners and with the leverage of non-dilutive resources, while at the same time, creating a significant impact in underserved communities. The opening of OnKai's platform to Galmed provides it with a tighter relationship with foundations and patient advocacy organizations. This is intended to play a key role in pursuing orphan indications combined with other sources of non-dilutive financing. It is exciting to join hands with a team that brings decades of experience in innovations, local clinics, healthcare professionals, charities, and pharma companies. We believe this type of integration is mandatory to improve the quality and efficiency of drug development and clinical trials.\"\n",

Aramchol's ability to modulate hepatic lipid metabolism was discovered and validated in animal models, demonstrating downregulation of the three key pathologies of NASH: steatosis, inflammation and fibrosis. The effect of Aramchol on fibrosis is mediated by downregulation of steatosis and directly on human collagen producing cells. Aramchol has been granted Fast Track designation status by the FDA for the treatment of NASH. NASH is an emerging world crisis impacting an estimated 3% to 5% of the U.S. population and an estimated 2% to 4% globally. It is the fastest growing cause of liver cancer and liver transplant in the U.S. due to the rise in obesity. NASH is the progressive form of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease that can lead to cardiovascular disease, cirrhosis and liver-related mortality.\n",

      "Heading: Galmed Pharmaceuticals Announces U.S. FDA Approval of Fast Track Designation of Aramchol for the Treatment of NASH\n",
      "Content: TEL AVIV, Israel, Sept. 23, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- Galmed Pharmaceuticals Ltd. (Nasdaq:GLMD) (\"Galmed\"), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of a once-daily, oral therapy for the treatment of liver diseases and cholesterol gallstones, announced today that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, approved its request for Fast Track Designation of its product candidate, aramchol, for the treatment of Non-Alcoholic Steato-Hepatitis, or NASH. FDA Fast Track Designation facilitates the development, and expedites the review, of drugs which treat a serious or life-threatening condition and fill an unmet medical need.  According to scientific literature, NASH is a chronic disease that affects approximately12% of the population in United States and in certain European Union nations and its prevalence is expected to increase in parallel with increased rates of obesity and diabetes. There are currently no approved drugs for the treatment of NASH. As Galmed recently disclosed, Galmed intends to begin, later this year, a Phase IIb clinical trial of aramchol in 240 NASH patients who also suffer from obesity and insulin resistance in Israel, Europe and certain Latin American countries. This planned Phase IIb clinical trial is in accordance with the study design recommended by the United Kingdom's Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, deemed acceptable by Germany's Bundesinstitut fur Arzneimittel und Medizinprodukte, or BfArM, deemed satisfactory by France's Agence Nationale de Securite du Medicament et des Produits de Sante, or ANSM, and confirmed as acceptable by the FDA. BfArM and ANSM also confirmed, in minutes of each of their respective scientific advisory meetings, that if successful, this Phase IIb trial may serve as a basis for Phase III pivotal trials of aramchol. Further, the FDA cleared Galmed's Investigational New Drug application for aramchol in July 2014, which, following completion of certain preliminary testing and protocol matters required by the FDA in recent correspondence, will permit Galmed to conduct clinical trials of aramchol in the United States for the treatment of fatty liver disorders. Commenting on the FDA's Fast Track Designation of aramchol, Galmed's Chief Executive Officer, Allen Baharaff, stated: \"The Fast Track Designation of aramchol will allow for continued contact between Galmed and the FDA to optimally design aramchol's future studies, including clinical trials in the United States, and may enable Galmed to accelerate its development, FDA approval and the time to market.\"\n",

Co., Ltd. (\"Samil\") today announced the execution of a license agreement (the \"Agreement\") for an exclusive, royalty-bearing license for the commercialization of Aramchol™ (with an option to manufacture) for the treatment of fatty liver indications including nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, or NASH, in the Republic of Korea, along (the \"License\"). Upon the signing of the Agreement, Samil will pay Galmed an up-front fee of approximately $2.0 million.  Samil has also agreed to pay additional clinical- and regulatory-based milestone payments, which may aggregate to $6.0 million, as well as tiered, double-digit royalties payable on sales (under certain limitations).  The funds provided by this Agreement will provide additional financing for Galmed's development programs.  Additionally, following the ARREST Study, Samil has an option to extend the License to Vietnam, which, if exercised, would increase the clinical- and regulatory-based milestone payments. \"Samil has a focused, gastrointestinal- and liver-related therapeutic strategy, which represents about one-third of their 2015 annual sales, as well as proven commercialization capabilities in these areas,\" stated Allen Baharaff, Galmed's President and Chief Executive Officer.  Mr. Baharaff continued, \"Since 2007, we have developed a deep relationship with Samil's executive management and are enthusiastic to ink our first commercial partnership with Samil, and in Asia.\" According to Samil and Korean-based key opinion leaders, the prevalence of fatty liver disease in Korea is significant, growing, and of serious medical concern.  The prevelence of NAFLD in subjects with diabetes, obesity and dyslipidemia is estimated to range between 25-35% of the high-risk population1.  Accordingly, Samil estimates that the addressable market of possible NASH patients in South Korea is between 500,000 to 1,000,0002. Mr. Seung Bum Huh, Samil's President and Chief Executive Officer, added \"Our focus on gastrointestinal and liver-related therapeutics is already evident in Korea, and we have every intention to fortify and build our capabilities, and range of drugs in this category even larger going forward.\"  Mr. Huh continued, \"We have evaluated a host of new therapeutics within the NASH category, and believe that Aramchol™ fits well into our strategy.  \"Furthermore, in the NASH space, we also believe Aramchol™ is uniquely positioned, as it targets the underlying cause of the disease, addresses both the hepatic and metabolic-related issues, and has demonstrated a clean safety profile in its clinical development to date,\" Mr. Huh concluded. About Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease and Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis: Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common cause of chronic liver disease in the United States and it affects almost 30% of adults in Western countries.  With climbing obesity rates and more sedentary patient populations, the prevalence of NAFLD is increasing worldwide and is becoming the predominant cause of chronic liver disease in parts of the world.  NAFLD represents a spectrum of diseases ranging from simple excess liver fat, or steatosis, to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).  NASH is the progressive form of fatty liver disease that can lead to cardiovascular disease, cirrhosis and liver-related mortality in persons who drink little or no alcohol.  NASH represents the more severe end of this spectrum and is characterized by steatosis, ballooning degeneration and lobular inflammation with or without fibrosis.  Long-term risks of NASH include cardiovascular disease, cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma and end stage liver disease requiring liver transplantation.\n",

(Nasdaq: GLMD) (\"Galmed\"), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of a once-daily, oral medication for the treatment of liver diseases and cholesterol gallstones, announced today that it purchased 60 EndoPAT™ devices and accessories from Itamar Medical Ltd. (TASE: ITMR) (\"Itamar Medical\"), a publicly-traded medical device company whose technology has been cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, for endothelial, or arterial, function assessment, which is a novel risk marker for cardiovascular disease. Galmed intends to use Itamar Medical's EndoPAT technology to include an assessment of endothelial function in its planned Phase IIb clinical trial of its drug candidate, aramchol, involving 240 Non-Alcoholic Steato-Hepatitis, or NASH, patients suffering from obesity and insulin resistance.  As Galmed previously disclosed, this Phase IIb clinical trial is expected to begin later this year and involve medical centers within the European Union, Israel and Latin America. According to scientific literature, NASH patients are at risk of developing cardiovascular complications and severe liver complications, such as cirrhosis of the liver and liver cancer. Mr. Allen Baharaff, Galmed's Chief Executive Officer, commented: \"The collaboration with Itamar Medical will allow Galmed to further its understanding of aramchol's effect on endothelial function, which may be impaired in NASH patients.  In aramchol's prior Phase IIa clinical trial, we observed a dose-dependent non-statistically significant improvement in endothelial function, which suggests a positive effect of the drug on early stage atherosclerosis, or hardening of the arteries, in addition to a significant reduction in liver fat content. If our planned Phase IIb trial confirms aramchol's effect on endothelial function in NASH patients, we believe that EndoPAT could potentially be used by physicians in out-patient clinics as a non-invasive test for aramchol's effect on vascular function.\" Mr. Gilad Glick, Chief Executive Officer of Itamar Medical, announced: \"This is an important vote of confidence, and additional proof of the great interest and need for the EndoPAT technology for the assessment of arterial function, from an aspiring Israeli pharmaceutical company traded on the Nasdaq Capital Market. We are proud of this collaboration and excited that Galmed has chosen to use Itamar Medical's technology as a marker of cardiovascular risk in a large scale clinical trial. Galmed's use of the EndoPAT technology follows several similar studies using the EndoPAT technology that we have conducted for several years in collaboration with leading pharmaceutical companies such as Hoffman La-Roche and AstraZeneca.\"\n",

Aramchol's ability to modulate hepatic lipid metabolism was discovered and validated in animal models, demonstrating downregulation of the three key pathologies of NASH: steatosis, inflammation and fibrosis. The effect of Aramchol on fibrosis is mediated by downregulation of steatosis and directly on human collagen producing cells. Aramchol has been granted Fast Track designation status by the FDA for the treatment of NASH. NASH is an emerging world crisis impacting an estimated 3% to 5% of the U.S. population and an estimated 2% to 4% globally. It is the fastest growing cause of liver cancer and liver transplant in the U.S. due to the rise in obesity. NASH is the progressive form of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease that can lead to cardiovascular disease, cirrhosis and liver-related mortality.\n",
      "Heading: Galmed Pharmaceuticals Provides Business Update and Reports First Quarter 2020 Financial Results\n",
      "Content: TEL AVIV, Israel, May 14, 2020 /PRNewswire/ --Galmed Pharmaceuticals Ltd. (Nasdaq: GLMD) (\"Galmed\" or the \"Company\"), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of the liver targeted SCD1 modulator Aramchol™, an oral therapy for the treatment of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, or NASH and fibrosis, provides today updated information on the Company's clinical development program and reports financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2020. The Company will host a conference call and webcast at 08:30 ET today.  Galmed announces significant progress in the development of Aramchol meglumine, a salt version of Aramchol which has higher solubility, the same ADME profile, and is expected to have less variability in human plasma. Aramchol meglumine is considered a New Chemical Entity. As such, it is eligible for NCE patent protection until December 2034. Patents have been granted and maintained in 37 European territories, in Japan, Australia, China and Canada. Discussions on the patent protection in the USA with the USPTO are ongoing. Results from a single and multiple oral administration doses of Aramchol free acid and Aramchol meglumine in a cross over PK study in dogs, demonstrated bioequivalence with reduced variability. In particular: Galmed plans to submit these results along with other supportive data to the FDA and discuss with the FDA, as soon as practical, a plan to appropriately transition from Aramchol free acid to the Aramchol meglumine in the ongoing ARMOR Phase 3 study. Based on Galmed's regulatory and scientific review of relevant FDA guidance and precedents, the Company's assessment is that this change during Phase 3 could be considered acceptable provided bioequivalence of the two products is established and a number of other data considerations are addressed. \"Over the last few years, Galmed has been in the process of developing a new product, Aramchol meglumine, which is a salt form of Aramchol free acid. It is important to note that Aramchol meglumine and Aramchol acid circulate as Aramchol regardless of which drug product is administered. The markedly higher solubility of Aramchol meglumine results in lower variability which is a significant added benefit. We are excited to share with you today this important development. By developing a salt version of Aramchol we are able to take the important step towards gaining patent protection on the drug until December 2034. We have long understood the importance of securing a meaningful period of patent protected opportunity for our drug as we plan for our Phase 3 and beyond,\" said Allen Baharaff, Chief Executive Officer of Galmed. Galmed plans on holding a virtual Analyst's Day in the coming months to discuss the details of this program. Response to COVID-19 Galmed continues to monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on its operations and is committed to ensuring the health, safety and well-being of its clinical study participants, staff at its study sites and employees.  During the second quarter of 2020, Galmed expects to lift some of the constraints in states in the US identified as \"green states\" allowing individual investigators to determine whether it is safe to resume screening activities. Galmed's current assessment is that by the fourth quarter of 2020, it will be able to resume recruitment in most of the ARMOR study sites. Accordingly, Galmed is updating its guidance for completion of recruitment of patients for the first part of the study from the second quarter of 2021 to the fourth quarter of 2021 and reporting of top-line results for the first part of the study from the fourth quarter of 2022 to the second half of 2023. The rapid development and fluidity of the COVID-19 pandemic precludes any firm estimates as to the ultimate effect this disease will have on the ARMOR study and is subject to change.

      "Heading: Galmed Pharmaceuticals Unfolds the Development of Aramchol™ Non-Invasive Companion Diagnostic Program\n",
      "Content: TEL AVIV, Israel, July 8, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Galmed Pharmaceuticals Ltd. (Nasdaq: GLMD) (\"Galmed\"), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of a once-daily, oral therapy for the treatment of liver diseases, announced today that it has entered into a Research, Option and License Agreement (\"License Agreement\") and a Share Purchase Agreement with One Way Liver Genomics S.L. (\"OWL\"), for the development of a non-invasive, blood-based companion diagnostic tool.  Under the License Agreement, Galmed and OWL will work together during Galmed's Phase IIb ARREST Study to develop a non-invasive blood test including metabolic markers that could potentially predict therapeutic responses to AramcholTM, Galmed's once-daily, oral therapy for the treatment of Non-Alcoholic Steato-Hepatitis, or NASH. The development of this proprietary non-invasive companion diagnostic for AramcholTM serves a dual purpose: Under the terms of the License Agreement, OWL will develop a proprietary companion diagnostic exclusive for AramcholTM, which will be co-funded by Galmed up to €437,000 over the course of the ARREST Study and paid based on reaching development milestones.  Upon commercialization, OWL may earn 10% royalties on annual net sales of the companion diagnostic product. Separately, under the terms of the Share Purchase Agreement, OWL stands to earn two milestone payments during the ARREST Study:  The first payment of €75,000 will be paid upon the successful completion of the ARREST Study's interim results expected during the first half of 2016; the second milestone payment of €100,000 will be paid upon the successful completion of the ARREST Study.  Through these two milestone payments, totaling €175,000, Galmed shall receive shares of OWL based on its most recent valuation.  Finally, OWL has granted Galmed an option to purchase additional shares up to 19.9% of OWL. Building on several years of collaboration between Galmed and OWL, today's announcement further positions the companies as front-runners in the treatment and diagnosis of NASH, and other liver diseases. \"In order to diagnose and treat the vast number of NASH patients, it's imperative that Galmed takes a comprehensive approach.  It's critical that the medical and scientific community collaborate to find validated, non-invasive diagnostic tools.  It's clear that today's standard of care for the diagnosis of NASH – an invasive liver biopsy – will become obsolete over the coming years and will not serve as a suitable follow-up tool to determine the success of treatment.  Galmed is endeavoring to assume a leadership role in both the treatment and diagnosis of NASH,\" stated Allen Baharaff, Galmed's President and Chief Executive Officer.  Mr. Baharaff continued, \"The collaboration with OWL, one of the world's leading metabolomics companies, is an important milestone in our strategic development plan.\" \"Our team of liver research professionals are proud to be involved in the exciting and innovative clinical development of AramcholTM.  OWL recognizes the unique synergies that will be created with Galmed in the development of AramcholTM.  The studies that we will perform during the ARREST Study, will allow us to obtain a more advanced OWLiver® product, our non-invasive test to diagnose NASH and identify surrogate markers linked to AramcholTM response in patients suffering from NASH.  We believe that regulatory agencies will recognize the benefits of non-invasive approaches for the diagnosis of NASH,\" commented Pablo Ortiz, MD, PhD, OWL's Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Baharaff and Dr. Ortiz concluded, \"Today's partnership, which is the first step in the identification of biomarkers capable of predicting an individual's response to AramcholTM is critical to the development of personalized strategies that will optimize therapeutic outcomes.\"\n",
      "Heading: Galmed Pharmaceuticals and the University of California, San Diego Enter into an Investigator-Initiated Clinical Trial Agreement to Assess Aramchol™ Effects Juvenile Population\n",
      "Content: TEL AVIV, Israel, Sept. 22, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Galmed Pharmaceuticals Ltd. (Nasdaq: GLMD) (\"Galmed\" or the \"Company\"), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of a once-daily, oral therapy for the treatment of liver diseases, today announced that it has signed an Investigator-Initiated Clinical Trial Agreement with the University of California, San Diego, School of Medicine (the \"University\").  The proposed study is a Phase I/IIa trial to assess safety, tolerability, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of AramcholTM in a juvenile population with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) (the \"ARTISAN Study\").  The ARTISAN Study (ARamcholTM Trial to Improve Steatosis in Adolescent NAFLD) is to be led by Dr. Jeffrey Schwimmer, Professor of Clinical Pediatrics at the University. Fatty liver disease in children has been increasingly recognized as an important pediatric health problem.  Pediatric NAFLD has some features that are similar to adults and several features that are unique to children.  In the United States, there are an estimated 5 to 8 million children with NAFLD.  The prevalence of NAFLD in children across the developed world is 5 to 10%.  From a liver standpoint, the major concern is that NAFLD is a risk factor for cirrhosis and liver cancer.  Beyond the risk for serious liver problems, children with NAFLD are also at increased risk for other important health problems including type 2 diabetes and atherosclerotic heart disease. \"NAFLD is the leading cause of chronic liver disease, yet there is no approved therapy in children or adults.  Based upon promising data in adults, the University is developing a proof-of-concept trial for AramcholTM in adolescents with NAFLD,\" said Jeffrey Schwimmer, MD, professor of pediatrics, University of California, San Diego, School of Medicine and Director, Fatty Liver Clinic, Rady Children's Hospital, San Diego. The ARTISAN Study is subject to receipt of regulatory approvals and is currently expected to be initiated in the first half of 2017. Galmed's President and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Allen Baharaff, stated \"The ARTISAN Study marks the third investigator-initiated clinical trial and continues our strategy of collaborating with leading investigators to evaluate AramcholTM's efficacy across different populations and indications. We believe addressing the unmet need for treatment of juvenile population with NAFLD should not await the clinical development for adults.  Based on AramcholTM's safety profile and mechanism-of-action, we decided to approach this important indication in parallel with our ongoing adult studies.\" About Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease and Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis:Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common cause of chronic liver disease in the United States and it affects almost 30% of adults in Western countries. With climbing obesity rates and more sedentary patient populations, the prevalence of NAFLD is increasing worldwide and is becoming the predominant cause of chronic liver disease in parts of the world. NAFLD represents a spectrum of diseases ranging from simple excess liver fat, or steatosis, to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). NASH is the progressive form of fatty liver disease that can lead to cardiovascular disease, cirrhosis and liver-related mortality in persons who drink little or no alcohol. NASH represents the more severe end of this spectrum and is characterized by steatosis, ballooning degeneration and lobular inflammation with or without fibrosis. Long-term risks of NASH include cardiovascular disease, cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma and end stage liver disease requiring liver transplantation.\n",

Aramchol™'s ability to modulate hepatic lipid metabolism was discovered and validated in animal models, demonstrating down regulation of the three key pathologies of NASH; steatosis, inflammation and fibrosis. The effect of Aramchol™ on fibrosis is mediated by down regulation of steatosis and directly on human collagen producing cells. Aramchol™ has been granted by the FDA Fast Track designation status for the treatment of NASH. NASH is an emerging world crisis impacting 3% to 5% of the U.S. population and 2% to 4% globally. It is the fastest growing cause of liver cancer and liver transplant in the U.S. due to the rise in obesity.

      "Heading: Galmed announces positive results of Phase 1 study of Amilo-5MER\n",
      "Content: TEL AVIV, Israel, Jan. 10, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Galmed Pharmaceuticals Ltd. (Nasdaq: GLMD) (\"Galmed\" or the \"Company\"), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company for liver, metabolic and inflammatory diseases announced today results of a Phase 1 clinical trial of Amilo-5MER in healthy volunteers that demonstrated an excellent safety profile and tolerability. Amilo-5MER is a synthetic peptide consisting of 5 amino acids that significantly reduces symptoms and histopathological hallmarks of IBD in animal models (TNBS, DSS). TNBS and DSS are well-established and widely recognized models of acute colitis. Amilo-5MER also showed anti-inflammatory effects in animal models of multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis. Amilo-5MER exerts its anti-inflammatory effects by binding with high affinity to pro-inflammatory amyloid proteins, preventing polymerization of Serum Amyloid A (SAA) monomers and thereby interfering with SAA-induced immune cell activation. The safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of single and multiple doses of Amilo-5MER were assessed in a first-in-human study in healthy subjects. The Phase I study was conducted in a single-center, using a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled design. Overall, 64 healthy male and female subjects were enrolled in the study. Cohorts of 8 subjects were randomized to receive Amilo-5MER or placebo by subcutaneous injection in a ratio of 6:2. In Part 1, cohorts of young male adults received single ascending doses of 10, 30, 90, 180 and 360 mg; in Part 2, a single cohort received doses of 180 mg BID for 5 consecutive days and in Part 3 a single cohort of healthy elderly male and female subjects received a single dose of 180 mg. All doses of Amilo-5MER were well tolerated with no clinically significant adverse events and none considered related to the investigational product.  All subjects completed the study as per protocol.  Plasma concentrations of Amilo-5MER increased in proportion to dose. Prof John Posner Visiting Professor, School of Life Sciences & Medicine, King's College London who served as medical monitor commented, \"Serum Amyloid A is an important inducer of inflammation and Amilo-5MER has real potential to serve as a first in class, specific anti-inflammatory agent with multiple disease indications.  It also has the potential to inhibit cytokine release syndrome.\" \"We are excited to bring Amilo-5MER into the clinical phase and look forward to advancing our product pipeline to address additional important indications for the benefit of patients around the world,\" noted Allen Baharaff, President and CEO of Galmed. Galmed is developing Amilo-5MER for multiple routes of administration and multiple indications. The Company plans to submit an IND for mild to moderate ulcerative colitis in 2022. Galmed Pharmaceuticals Ltd. Galmed Pharmaceuticals Ltd. is a clinical stage drug development biopharmaceutical company for liver, metabolic and inflammatory diseases. Our lead compound, Aramchol™, a backbone drug candidate for the treatment of NASH and fibrosis is currently in a Phase 3 registrational study.

With climbing obesity rates and more sedentary patient populations, the prevalence of NAFLD is increasing worldwide and is becoming the predominant cause of chronic liver disease in parts of the world. NAFLD represents a spectrum of diseases ranging from simple excess liver fat, or steatosis, to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). NASH is the progressive form of fatty liver disease that can lead to cardiovascular disease, cirrhosis and liver-related mortality in persons who drink little or no alcohol. NASH represents the more severe end of this spectrum and is characterized by steatosis, ballooning degeneration and lobular inflammation with or without fibrosis. Long-term risks of NASH include cardiovascular disease, cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma and end stage liver disease requiring liver transplantation.\n",

As a result of the foregoing research and development and general and administrative expenses, as well as our failure to generate revenues from operations since our inception, for the quarter ended March 31, 2014, our net loss was $2.2 million, representing an increase of $1.6 million as compared to our net loss for the comparable prior year period. \"We believe that our existing cash resources and the net proceeds from our initial public offering will be sufficient to fund our projected cash requirements through 2017, which is approximately 12 months after the anticipated completion of our currently planned Phase IIb clinical trial of aramchol in NASH patients who are overweight or obese and who also suffer from Type II Diabetes or elevated fasting glucose levels,\" said Allen Baharaff, Galmed's Chief Executive Officer. \"We recently commenced patient screening for our pharmacokinetic and food effect studies of aramchol, as was recommended by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in written correspondence from December 2013. We expect these studies to provide additional safety data to further support existing safety data from our prior pre-clinical studies and Phase I and Phase IIa clinical trials of aramchol. We anticipate completing the studies by the end of the third quarter of this year, which we anticipate will allow us to progress with aramchol's clinical program as planned and to initiate our Phase IIb clinical trial of aramchol in NASH in the fourth quarter of this year\", said Galmed's Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Maya Halperin.

      "Heading: Galmed Pharmaceuticals Announces Acceleration of its New Clinical Amilo-5MER program\n",
      "Content: TEL AVIV, Israel, Aug. 6, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- Galmed Pharmaceuticals Ltd. (Nasdaq: GLMD) (\"Galmed\" or the \"Company\"), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company for liver, metabolic and inflammatory diseases provides today updated information on the Company's pipeline program.   Galmed is happy to announce significant progress in the development of Amilo-5MER, a 5 amino acid synthetic peptide MTADV (Methionine, Threonine, Alanine, Aspartic acid, Valine). The 5 amino acids sequence of Amilo-5MER is homologue to a specific MTADV sequence in the human CD44 variant found in synovial fluid cells from joints of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients. Amilo-5MER is being developed through a research collaboration between Galmed and the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. The molecule originated in the laboratory of Prof. David Naor, from the Lautenberg Center for Immunology and Cancer Research, Faculty of Medicine, The Hebrew University. Prof. Naor and his team were the first to publish this specific sequence in the prestigious scientific communication Journal of Clinical Investigation 1. Amilo-5MER binds to three pro-inflammatory amyloid proteins, Serum Amyloid A (SAA), Transthyretin and Apolipoprotein B with high affinity. The first two are known to be active only in their aggregated forms. By binding to SAA, Amilo-5MER interferes with SAA aggregation and therefor inhibits the destructive autocrine, self-amplifying cytokine loop that causes additional inflammatory reaction. We are presenting today mechanistic and pre-clinical data which supports an IND submission and the initiation of first in human studies expected to begin later this year. SAA constitutes acute phase reactants, whose concentration in serum rise rapidly in response to acute stimuli such as infection and trauma. An elevated concentration of SAA was identified in sera of patients with multiple autoimmune diseases and more recently, an outstanding increase of SAA was also detected in COVID-19 infected patients2-3. SAA in its aggregated form, is a potent and rapid inducer of cytokine secretion (particularly Interleukin 6 (IL-6). IL-6 plays an important role in chronic inflammation and is implicated in the pathogenesis of many autoimmune diseases, such as Multiple Sclerosis (MS), Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) and acute COVID 19. Interference with SAA polymerization and aggregation is a valid target to prevent chronic inflammatory conditions. Amilo-5MER has been shown to significantly reduce chronic inflammation in animal models of RA, IBD and MS (research work supported by a grant to Prof. Naor from the National Multiple Sclerosis Society (NMSS) of the USA). Amilo-5MER provides a unique mechanism of action to interfere with this vicious cycle, enabling a specific treatment for chronic inflammatory diseases. Data generated from multiple in-vitro, in-vivo and human ex-vivo models have shown that Amilo-5MER significantly improves clinical symptoms. Histological improvements and reduction of pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion were also observed. An ex-vivo study to investigate the effect of Amilo-5MER on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from healthy subjects stimulated by SAA, demonstrated significant reduction of IL-6 secretion.  This data suggests that Amilo-5MER may also have a role in the treatment of patients with severe COVID-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), characterized by significantly high levels of SAA and IL-6 secretion which is the main cause for the cytokine storm in these patients. An ex–vivo study on PBMCs of patients infected with Covid-19 is ongoing. An alternative mechanism to reduce IL-6 levels (via humanized monoclonal antibody IL-6 receptor antagonist) is currently being evaluated in a Phase 3 Study sponsored by Hoffman La Roche (COVACTA) in Patients with Severe COVID-19 Pneumonia (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04320615). Amilo-5MER is considered a New Chemical Entity. As such, it is eligible for NCE patent protection until July 2034. Patents have been granted and maintained in the US (US 1061181937), Europe (EP 3169343) and Australia (AU 2015291151) and have been allowed in Japan (JP 6671363). \"Specifically targeting SAA, the key player in this destructive, autocrine, self-amplifying vicious cycle of inflammation, without suppressing the patient's ability to mount sufficient immune response, has been an unresolved aim in clinical research. Amilo-5MER provides a unique mechanism of action to interfere with this vicious cycle, enabling a specific treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases and hopefully also acute COVID 19. Amilo-5MER has an excellent safety profile and provides a promising selective immune modulation without affecting the patient's immune surveillance,\" said Dr. Liat Hayardeny, Chief Scientific Officer of Galmed. Allen Baharaff, Galmed's CEO noted: \"Amilo-5MER is an exciting and complimentary addition to Galmed's pipeline which focus on liver, metabolic and immune diseases. The accelerated development of Amilo-5MER from proof of concept to a Phase 1-ready compound demonstrates our core competence in identifying and efficiently advancing scientific innovation molecules from Israeli academia to clinical studies. Galmed's senior research and development team has years of CMC, toxicology, regulatory and clinical experience in successfully developing peptides for chronic inflammatory diseases from bench to bedside. We are looking forward to the rapid clinical development of Amilo-5MER for the benefit of the many patients in need.\"  Recent research and development of Amilo-5MER is being conducted under a research and option agreement between Galmed and Yissum, the tech transfer company of the Hebrew University. Galmed has completed all IND-enabling studies for Amilo-5MER, including API manufacturing, toxicology, and other supporting data. Galmed is planning to submit an IND in Q4 2020 and initiate a first in human Phase 1 study in the UK in Q4 2020. If the Phase 1 study is successful, Galmed plans to exercise its option to receive an exclusive license to the Amilo-5MER technology and enter into a definitive license agreement with Yissum. Initiation of a Phase 1b/2a study for biomarkers (SAA in serum) for IBD is planned in H2 21 as well as potentially for the treatment of COVID-19.

(Nasdaq: GLMD) (\"Galmedˮ or the \"Company\"), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of the liver targeted SCD1 modulator Aramchol™, a once-daily, oral therapy for the treatment of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, or NASH and other liver diseases, announced today top-line results from the ARRIVE Trial, which did not meet its primary endpoint. ARRIVE, a Phase IIa, investigator initiated clinical trial conducted at the University of California San Diego by Professor Rohit Loomba was a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, 12 weeks, proof-of-concept study that evaluated the safety and efficacy of Aramchol™ at 600mg/day versus placebo in 50 patients with HIV-associated lipodystrophy and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, or NAFLD. The primary endpoint of the study was improvement of liver fat at 12 weeks, as measured by MRI-PDFF. Liver biopsies were not included as part of the evaluation in this pilot trial. The trial showed no difference between HIV patients receiving Aramchol™ for 12 weeks when compared with HIV patients in the placebo arm. Aramchol™ showed a favorable safety and tolerability profile. Further analysis of the data is ongoing. Topline data from Galmed's Phase IIb ARREST study with 248 NASH patients assessing Aramchol™ 400 and 600mg/day following 52 weeks treatment, with endpoints measured by MRS and liver biopsies, is expected in Q2 2018. Prof. Rohit Loomba, Principal Investigator of the ARRIVE study commented: \"While further analysis is required, the results may mean that the pathogenesis of HIV-related NAFLD is likely different and potentially due to a complex mix of triggers that are both unique to HIV-associated NAFLD and may also have some shared pathways with primary NAFLD. The fatty liver disease in HIV lipodystrophy patients also has underlying fat destruction which may be different from the features that are seen in \"garden variety NASH.\" Allen Baharaff, Chief Executive Officer of Galmed, stated, \"Aramchol, with its unique mechanism of action, favorable safety and tolerability profile, is being evaluated in a variety of liver diseases. Treating fatty liver disease, in the presence of the lipodystrophy associated with HIV and/or HIV therapy, may be more complex than treating fatty liver disease (NASH) in the non-HIV infected population. Prof. Loomba is a pioneer in this research for a well-deserved patient population.  It will be important for researchers and companies to evaluate other therapeutic agents, alone or in combination, in the spectrum of fatty liver disease and lipodystrophy in the HIV infected population.\" About Aramchol™ and Non-alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH) Aramchol™ (arachidyl amido cholanoic acid) is a novel fatty acid bile acid conjugate, inducing beneficial modulation of intra-hepatic lipid metabolism.

This year's forum will cover the currently accepted scoring methodologies for non-invasive prediction of NAFLD severity, as well as provide an overview on the latest research of non-invasive biomarkers.  New approaches based on blood, metabolomic and microbiome profiling will be reviewed.  The forum will also discuss imaging tools, such as MRI and new forms of elastometry methods for non-invasive quantification of hepatic steatosis and fibrosis. Faculty members include Prof. Vlad Ratzio (Hôpital Pitié Salpêtrière and Université Pierre et Marie Curie, Paris, France), the ARREST Study global Principle Investigator, Prof. Rohit Loomba (University of California at San Diego, California, USA), Prof. José Mato (bioGUNE and CIC biomaGUNE, Basque Country, Spain), amongst others. Professor Vlad Ratziu, the forum Chairperson, commented, \"Providing effective therapies to NASH patients is not just about research and testing of promising compounds in clinical trials.  It is also about optimizing performance of non-invasive diagnostic methods that identify patients at risk and follow progression of the disease or treatment response.\"  Prof. Ratziu continued, \"With their vision and understanding of the field, Galmed is now a key partner to dedicated investigators worldwide in our collective effort to develop all aspects of NASH management.\" Allen Baharaff, President and Chief Executive Officer of Galmed, added \"At Galmed, we are acutely aware of the clinical need to develop non-invasive diagnostic tools for NASH, and are devoted to supporting these developments.\"  Mr. Baharaff continued, \"We believe that highly valuable information will be generated from the approximately 1000 screened and randomized subjects in the ARREST Study.  This data will enable us to collaborate with diagnostic leading companies to develop and validate non-invasive prognostic tools to differentiate between NAFLD and NASH patients, as well as design a complementary diagnostic tool for Aramchol's efficacy.\"  Mr. Baharaff concluded, \"Ultimately, Galmed aims to take comprehensive ownership of the patient's treatment path.\" About Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease and Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis:Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common cause of chronic liver disease in the United States and it affects almost 30% of adults in Western countries. With climbing obesity rates and more sedentary patient populations, the prevalence of NAFLD is increasing worldwide and is becoming the predominant cause of chronic liver disease in parts of the world. NAFLD represents a spectrum of diseases ranging from simple excess liver fat, or steatosis, to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). NASH is the progressive form of fatty liver disease that can lead to cardiovascular disease, cirrhosis and liver-related mortality in persons who drink little or no alcohol. NASH represents the more severe end of this spectrum and is characterized by steatosis, ballooning degeneration and lobular inflammation with or without fibrosis. Long-term risks of NASH include cardiovascular disease, cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma and end stage liver disease requiring liver transplantation.\n",
      "Heading: Galmed Pharmaceuticals Announces the Filing of a Provisional Patent Application for the Use of Aramchol for the Treatment of Lipodystrophy\n",
      "Content: TEL AVIV, Israel, Jun 09, 2014 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE via COMTEX) -- Galmed Pharmaceuticals Ltd. GLMD +0.79%  (\"Galmed\"), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of a once-daily, oral therapy for the treatment of liver diseases and cholesterol gallstones, announced today that it filed a provisional patent application in the United States for the use of its drug, aramchol, for the treatment of lipodystrophy. Lipodystrophy is a medical condition characterized by abnormal or degenerative conditions of adipose tissue, or body fat, including the loss of body fat from various regions of the body and its redistribution and accumulation in other areas. Lipodystrophy may be hereditary, but is commonly associated with HIV and AIDS patients who develop lipodystrophy from treatment with highly active antiretroviral therapies, or HAARTs, or other protease inhibitors. There is currently no approved medical treatment for lipodystrophy or its associated conditions. According to AIDS Reviews, 2005, approximately 40% of HIV patients treated for over one year with a protease inhibitor will develop induced lipodystrophy. Patients with HAART-induced lipodystrophy may also develop non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, or NAFLD, with some of such patients progressing to cirrhosis, hypertriglyceridemia, or high triglyceride blood levels, or diabetes. In Galmed's Phase IIa clinical trial of aramchol in 60 NAFLD patients, Galmed observed a significant reduction in liver fat and improvement of certain metabolic parameters. Galmed currently intends to seek potential collaborations with U.S. academic centers to explore the use of aramchol for the treatment of lipodystrophy. \"In most cases, the effective use of HAART results in better treatment of AIDS such that it may become a manageable, chronic disease. However, the use of HAART has also created a need for a more effective treatment of lipodystrophy in this patient population,\" said Galmed's Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Maya Halperin. \"We currently believe that aramchol could become a viable treatment option for these patients and potentially result in improved quality of life,\" added Dr. Halperin.\n",

Being granted the trial approval by the NMPA is of great significance as it brings us a step closer to offering an optimized new oral therapy to patients with NASH and fibrosis who now have very limited treatment options.\" The ARMOR study is evaluating the efficacy and safety of Aramchol in subjects with NASH and fibrosis stages 2-3 who are overweight or obese and have prediabetes or type 2 diabetes. The study consists of two parts. The first part is an open-label study that is designed to evaluate the treatment response, pharmacokinetics and safety of twice daily administration (BID) of Aramchol 300mg and explore the kinetics of histological outcome measures as well as several non-invasive tests (including ProC3, ELF and Fibroscan) associated with NASH and fibrosis for the treatment duration of 24, 48 and 72 weeks. The second part is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study with a histology-based surrogate endpoint that is intended to serve as the basis for the submission of a marketing authorization application under regulatory provisions of accelerated/conditional approval. All subjects will continue with the same treatment assignment until study completion to confirm clinical efficacy. More information about the ARMOR Study may be found on ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04104321. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), a precursor of NASH, has an estimated prevalence rate in China that is expected to increase from 15%-20% in 2018 to 25%-30% in 2033, driven by increasing prevalence of obesity and type 2 diabetes. \"The approval of the IND application of the ARMOR Study in China is a significant milestone in the development of Aramchol for NASH patients,\" said Prof. Junqi Niu, Chief Physician, The First Hospital of Jilin University and ARMOR China Principal Investigator. \"Drug development is globalizing with worldwide interaction, licensing, and cross-licensing as regional studies are recognized unfeasible and China has the size and resources to become a leader in pharmaceutical innovation.

      "Heading: Galmed updates business and clinical development strategy to better leverage Aramchol's anti-fibrotic effects\n",
      "Content: TEL AVIV, Israel, May 17, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Galmed Pharmaceuticals Ltd. (Nasdaq: GLMD) (\"Galmed\" or the \"Company\"), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company for liver, metabolic, fibrosis and inflammatory diseases announced today the Company's clinical development strategy will expand into new anti-fibrotic indications to maximize the potential of its lead compound, Aramchol while at the same time discontinuing the Open Label Part of the Armor Study having reached its objectives. Expansion of Aramchol's clinical development to additional indications provide a potentially faster development pathway for regulatory approval based on three important factors: positive results from the first part of the ARMOR study showing a consistent antifibrotic effect, the timing of the initiation of the Double-Blind Part with the improved formulation of Aramchol Meglumine, and the pre-clinical data supporting the anti-fibrotic activity of Aramchol in other fibrotic and pro-fibrotic indications. The change aims to maximize the potential of Aramchol with better use of Company resources. The Company believes that the positive results obtained from the Open Label Part already provide sufficient data with regards to treatment duration, magnitude and consistency of effect, and taking into consideration biopsy reading challenges and potential new biopsy reading modalities, the Company concluded that the Open-Label Part has met its objective. At this stage continuing the Open Label Part as a standalone study is not expected to provide additional data to justify its continuation. In connection with the shift in development strategy, the Company is initiating a comprehensive plan which includes a cost reduction effort which will enable Galmed to develop Aramchol for new fibrotic indications with high unmet need and faster development pathways, while preparing for the registrational part of the ARMOR study which is expected to commence in the second half of 2023. To date, only limited anti-fibrotic drugs are approved or are in development, most of which have restricting side effects. The distinctive, direct anti-fibrotic mechanism of action of Aramchol and long-term safety profile demonstrated so far in advanced clinical studies make Aramchol a promising candidate for such indications. Galmed expects to be able to leverage in part the current clinical data to rapidly progress Aramchol into Phase 2 and 3 studies in new indications for use as monotherapy and in-combination. Allen Baharaff, Co-founder, President and CEO of Galmed commented \"Over the last year we have seen highly encouraging data of Aramchol's anti-fibrotic effects. Together with the extended patent for Aramchol meglumine to 2038, I am excited to prioritize anti fibrotic indications for Aramchol. Galmed remains optimistic that future years will see a breakthrough in the treatment of NASH and that Aramchol will be among the leading future NASH drug candidates. Simultaneously, Galmed is evaluating its strategic alternatives and its structuring to best enhance shareholder value and achieve its goals\". The Company has not stated a definitive timeline for completion of the evaluation process and there can be no assurance that the evaluation process will result in Galmed pursuing any strategic alternative, or that a strategic alternative, if any, would be completed successfully or at all. There can be no assurance that the review will result in any transaction or other strategic change or outcome. The Company does not intend to comment further until it determines that further disclosure is appropriate or necessary.\n",

      "Heading: Galmed Announces FDA Clearance of IND of Armachol for the Treatment of Fatty Liver Disorders\n",
      "Content: TEL AVIV, Israel, July 22, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- Galmed Pharmaceuticals Ltd. (Nasdaq: GLMD) (\"Galmed\"), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of a once-daily, oral therapy for the treatment of liver diseases and cholesterol gallstones, announced today that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, cleared Galmed's Investigational New Drug, or IND, application.  Such clearance will permit Galmed to conduct clinical trials of its product candidate, aramchol, in the United States for the treatment of fatty liver disorders. Galmed is initially developing aramchol for the treatment of Non-Alcoholic Steato-Hepatitis, or NASH.  According to scientific literature, NASH is a chronic disease that affects approxiately12% of the population in United States and in certain European Union nations and its prevalence is expected to increase in parallel with increased rates of obesity and diabetes. There are currently no approved drugs to treat NASH. In connection with the FDA's clearance of Galmed's IND application, Galmed submitted a request to the FDA for the approval of a Fast Track Designation for aramchol.  Fast Track Designation is a designation by the FDA that facilitates the development, and expedites the review, of drugs which treat a serious or life-threatening condition and fill an unmet medical need. \"We believe that the IND application clearance serves as an additional validation for our development program and will allow us to perform clinical studies for our primary indication, NASH, as well as additional proof of concept studies of aramchol in the United States in the future,\" said Allen Baharaff, Galmed's Chief Executive Officer. \"We further believe that the indications we are seeking to address with aramchol are increasingly relevant public health issues as they are major causes of cardiovascular and liver-related morbidity and mortality, with no approved treatment currently available.\" Aramchol, a conjugate of cholic acid and arachidic acid, is a first in class member of a novel family of synthetic Fatty-Acid / Bile-Acid Conjugates or FABACs. FABACs are composed of endogenic compounds, orally administrated with potentially good safety and tolerability parameters. As Galmed recently disclosed, Galmed intends to begin, later this year, a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging Phase IIb clinical trial of aramchol in 240 NASH patients who also suffer from obesity and insulin resistance.  The trial will have two co-primary end-points: significant reduction of liver fat content measured by NMRS and resolution of inflammation measured by 2 biopsies at the beginning and end of the study. This planned Phase IIb clinical trial for aramchol in NASH patients is in accordance with the study design recommended by the United Kingdom's Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, deemed acceptable by Germany's Bundesinstitut fur Arzneimittel und Medizinprodukte, or BfArM, deemed satisfactory by France's Agence Nationale de Securite du Medicament et des Produits de Sante, or ANSM, and confirmed as acceptable by the FDA. BfArM and ANSM also confirmed, in minutes of each of their respective scientific advisory meetings, that if successful, this Phase IIb trial may serve as a basis for Phase III pivotal trials of aramchol. To date, in a Phase IIa trial Galmed demonstrated that aramchol may reduce liver fat in a dose dependent manner, as evidenced by a statistically significant reduction of liver fat over a three-month treatment period of once-daily 300 mg doses of aramchol, and may induce positive trends of changes in several metabolic parameters.  The trial's primary efficacy end point was a reduction in liver fat content, without consideration of inflammation or fibrosis. The secondary efficacy end points measured differences between the aramchol-treated group and the placebo group with respect to alterations of liver enzyme levels, levels of adiponectin, homeostasis model assessment scores, and endothelial function.  All endpoints were met and there were no notable changes in biochemical, hematological, cardiovascular or other safety parameters, or any observable serious or drug-related adverse events in the 58 patients who completed the trial either during the three-month treatment period or during the subsequent recovery period.  Galmed further confirmed the appropriateness of a single daily dose of aramachol by pharmacokinetic analysis.\n",

About Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease and Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis:Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common cause of chronic liver disease in the United States and it affects almost 30% of adults in Western countries. With climbing obesity rates and more sedentary patient populations, the prevalence of NAFLD is increasing worldwide and is becoming the predominant cause of chronic liver disease in parts of the world. NAFLD represents a spectrum of diseases ranging from simple excess liver fat, or steatosis, to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). NASH is the progressive form of fatty liver disease that can lead to cardiovascular disease, cirrhosis and liver-related mortality in persons who drink little or no alcohol. NASH represents the more severe end of this spectrum and is characterized by steatosis, ballooning degeneration and lobular inflammation with or without fibrosis. Long-term risks of NASH include cardiovascular disease, cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma and end stage liver disease requiring liver transplantation.\n",

(Nasdaq: GLMD) (\"Galmed\" or the \"Company\"), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of a once-daily, oral therapy for the treatment of liver diseases, today announced financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2015. Financial Summary – First Quarter 2015 vs. First Quarter 2014: \"As you know, we officially announced the commencement of the ARREST Study during the first quarter of 2015, as well as the affiliation of Professor Vlad Ratziu as the ARREST Study's principal investigator, and Professor Rohit Loomba as the Study's U.S. principal investigator; these were major accomplishments,\" stated Allen Baharaff, Galmed's President and Chief Executive Officer.  \"The multinational ARREST Study of aramchol is expected to take place in approximately 80 centers in 12 countries.\" Galmed's ARREST Study is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging Phase IIb clinical trial of aramchol.  The trial's primary end-point is a statistically significant reduction of liver fat content measured by Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy, or MRS, and the trial's secondary end-point is the complete resolution of Non-Alcoholic Steato-Hepatitis, or NASH, as measured by two biopsies (at the beginning and at the end of the ARREST Study), the improvement of the NAFLD Activity Score (NAS) and an improvement in the markers of liver inflammation and various metabolic biomarkers. In addition, Galmed announced that it has expanded its clinical activities to include patient recruitment for the ARREST Study in the United States.  Mr. Baharaff stated, \"We believe that U.S.-based patient recruitment will shorten the recruitment time for our ARREST Study, as well as improve the study's breadth and relevance.\"  Galmed currently expects to release interim results of the ARREST Study in the first half of 2016.  Galmed further reaffirmed that it expects to release top-line data by the end of 2016. As previously communicated, during the fourth quarter of 2014, we initiated a single-center, double blind, randomized Phase IIa placebo-controlled proof-of-concept clinical trial of aramchol in 36 patients for the treatment of newly formed cholesterol gallstones following bariatric surgery.  Enrollment pace of the study has tracked significantly slower than anticipated.  Therefore, the Company decided to expand the trial into 3 additional centers.  Unfortunately, notwithstanding the significant efforts involved in the opening of the additional sites, enrollment has still continued to disappoint.  Consequently, we have filed a request with the principal investigator to cease enrollment in the underperforming center.  Accordingly, the Company is taking this opportunity to reexamine the study design in order to achieve a better recruitment.  We remain committed to the development for aramchol for cholesterol gallstones and hope to provide a revised strategy in the coming quarters. Mr. Baharaff concluded, \"our priorities for the rest of the year are very clear:  To ensure the highest quality, and timely execution of the ARREST Study.  All hands are on deck and we expect that it will stay that way.\" Conference Call Details Galmed will host a conference call and webcast today at 8:30 a.m. EDT / 5:30 a.m. PDT to discuss its financial results and to provide an update on current developments with respect to its clinical program for aramchol.  Investors interested in participating in the call can dial +1-888-401-4668 from the United States or +1-719-325-2469 for international callers, and use Conference ID 9285976.  A replay will be available through May 27, 2015, by dialing +1-877-870-5176 (United States) or +1-858-384-5517 (international); Passcode 9285976.  A webcast will also be available at http://galmedpharma.investorroom.com\n",

(Nasdaq: GLMD) (\"Galmed\" or the \"Company\"), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company for liver, metabolic and inflammatory diseases announced today the publication in The Journal of Autoimmunity for its IND ready compound, Amilo-5MER entitled: \"MTADV 5-MER peptide suppresses chronic inflammations as well as autoimmune pathologies and unveils a new potential target-Serum Amyloid A.\" Amilo-5MER, is a five amino acid in a specific sequence that was originally isolated from synovial fluid of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients. This human peptide displays an efficient anti-inflammatory effect to ameliorate pathology and clinical symptoms in mouse models of RA, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and multiple sclerosis (MS). The presumed MoA by which Amilo-5MER affects chronic inflammation is binding to SAA and preventing its ability to activate immune cells for pro inflammatory cytokine secretion. Studies have demonstrated that Amilo-5MER significantly inhibits the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-1β from SAA activated human fibroblasts, THP-1 monocytes and peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Amilo-5MER suppresses the pro-inflammatory IL-6 release from SAA-activated cells, but not from non-activated cells providing selective anti inflammatory properties. Prof.  David Naor, a winner of 2021 Kaye Prize for scientific innovation and  affiliated with  the Lautenberg Center of Immunology and Cancer Research, Faculty of Medicine, Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Israel and the inventor of Amilo-5MER commented \"Serum Amyloid A (SAA) initiates and activates the cascade of events leading to chronic inflammation by stimulating release of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6,IL-1β and TNFα, generating a \"cytokine storm\" and subsequently damage to the body tissues. Amilo-5MER, specifically binds to subunits of SAA, thereby neutralizing its pathological structure and consequently its ability to stimulate \"cytokine storm\", thus interfering with the inflammatory process. Challenged by the unmet needs of treating inflammatory diseases and preserving the immune surveillance of these patients, Amilo-5MER attenuates inflammation as a specific immune modulator while not interfering with acute immune response.\" Allen Baharaff, Galmed co-founder and CEO commented: \"I congratulate Prof. Naor for the publication of his pioneering research work on Amilo-5MER, unveiling its unique mechanism of action. Amilo-5MER demonstrated interference with SAA polymerization and aggregation which is essential for the activity of SAA. Aggregated SAA is the main cause and a bio - marker of chronic inflammation.  Amilo-5MER has a unique mode of action up stream to all pro inflammatory cytokine and can potentially be a therapeutic agent in numerous SAA-associated pathologies.\" Galmed Pharmaceuticals Ltd. Galmed Pharmaceuticals Ltd. is a clinical stage drug development biopharmaceutical company for liver, metabolic and inflammatory diseases.

      "Heading: Results of Galmed's Phase 2b ARREST Trial of Aramchol Published in Nature Medicine\n",
      "Content: TEL AVIV, Israel, October 11, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Galmed Pharmaceuticals Ltd. (Nasdaq: GLMD) (\"Galmed\" or the \"Company\"), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company for liver, metabolic and inflammatory diseases announced today that the one-year results of the global Phase 2b randomized placebo-controlled ARREST Trial of Aramchol in patients with NASH have been published in Nature Medicine (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-021-01495-3). The ARREST Phase 2b study randomized 247 patients with NASH confirmed by liver biopsy. Patients were randomized 2:2:1 to receive Aramchol 400mg, 600mg or placebo once daily. The manuscript describes the complete data analyses including reduction in liver fat by imaging, improvements in liver histology and liver enzymes as well as the very good safety profile of Aramchol. Aramchol is the most advanced down regulator of SCD 1 in clinical development. Aramchol, by targeting this single receptor, an important metabolic master switch, induces cascade of events that leads to two main changes: in hepatocytes, Aramchol elevates the fatty acids oxidation (or in other words – fat burn) and influences AMPK, which results also in reducing glycemic parameters; and in hepatic stellate cells, Aramchol down regulates collagen production (i.e. fibrosis). Data from the ARREST Phase 2b study published in this paper demonstrate how the mechanism of action of Aramchol translates into clinical performance. This published study, in addition to mechanistic studies demonstrated and published thus far, provided the rationale for the continued development of Aramchol for patients with NASH and fibrosis and a potential to further improved efficacy using higher drug exposure (>50% higher). The ARMOR study - a Phase 3, multinational, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Aramchol 300mg twice daily in subjects with NASH with an open-label part to evaluate the safety, PK and treatment response kinetics of Aramchol is currently ongoing (NCT04104321). Prof. Vlad Ratziu, Professor of Hepatology, Sorbonne Université, the paper's lead author and the ARMOR study co-principal investigator commented \"The publication of the detailed results of the ARREST trial in a prestigious general medical journal such as Nature Medicine speaks to the interest of the scientific community towards this molecule with an innovative mode of action and its potential for treating fibrotic NASH. We look forward to seeing the impact of an optimized Aramchol exposure in NASH patients from the Phase 3 ARMOR trial\" \"The publication of these data in Nature Medicine speaks to the strong interest from the clinical community in this unmet need area. We are grateful to all the patients and clinical sites that participated in the study around the world\", said Allen Baharaff, President and Chief Executive Officer of Galmed. \"Coupled with new recent publications elucidating Aramchol's MoA and particularly its direct effect on fibrosis, these results underscore the significant potential of Aramchol as a therapeutic option for patients diagnosed with NASH and Fibrosis. We are committed to evaluating the safety and efficacy of Aramchol in patients diagnosed with NASH and Fibrosis in our ongoing ARMOR Phase 3 study.\" About Aramchol and Non-alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH) Aramchol (arachidyl amido cholanoic acid) is a novel fatty acid bile acid conjugate, liver targeted SCD1 modulator, developed as an oral therapy for the treatment of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (\"NASH\") and fibrosis. Aramchol's ability to modulate hepatic lipid metabolism was discovered and validated in animal models, demonstrating downregulation of the three key pathologies of NASH: steatosis, inflammation and fibrosis. The effect of Aramchol on fibrosis is mediated by downregulation of steatosis and directly on human collagen producing cells. Aramchol has been granted Fast Track Designation status by the FDA for the treatment of NASH. NASH is an emerging world crisis impacting an estimated 3% to 5% of the U.S. population and an estimated 2% to 4% globally. It is the fastest growing cause of liver cancer and liver transplant in the U.S. due to the rise in obesity. NASH is the progressive form of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease that can lead to cardiovascular disease, cirrhosis and liver-related mortality. There are currently no approved therapies for NASH. Galmed Pharmaceuticals Ltd. Galmed Pharmaceuticals Ltd. is a clinical stage drug development biopharmaceutical company for liver, metabolic and inflammatory diseases. Our lead compound, Aramchol™, a backbone drug candidate for the treatment of NASH and fibrosis is currently in a Phase 3 registrational study.

      "Heading: Galmed to employ OnKai's disruptive Artificial Intelligence (AI) in its Planned Phase 2a Clinical Trial in PSC\n",
      "Content: OnKai's AI models redefine the methodologies and economics of clinical trials TEL AVIV, Israel, July 10, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Galmed Pharmaceuticals Ltd. (Nasdaq: GLMD) (\"Galmed\" or the \"Company\"), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company for liver, metabolic and fibrotic diseases, is delighted to announce the first step in its strategic partnership with OnKai, where OnKai will apply its artificial intelligence (AI), models for enrollment and execution of clinical trials in underserved communities, starting with Galmed's innovative Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (PSC) clinical development program. PSC is a rare, severe, chronic disease where progression is predominantly determined by biliary fibrosis. There are currently no approved drugs for the treatment of the disease, which gradually progresses to cirrhosis, often requiring liver transplantation. Aramchol has been shown to have anti-fibrotic effects in pre-clinical models in NASH idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and clinical studies in patients with NASH. The clinical development for PSC is expected to start with a Phase 2a study to be conducted at Virginia Commonwealth University beginning in the fourth quarter of 2023, followed by a Phase 2/3 confirmatory adaptive design trial. OnKai's innovative planning tool is anticipated to generate a comprehensive enrollment plan for each trial phase utilizing five new participation models that OnKai designed for integrating underserved communities in clinical studies. OnKai's Smart-Grid AI Platform will continuously support the trial in the selected local clinics. Local clinics will receive the tools and fair compensation to accompany their patients throughout the process, ensuring individual needs are not disregarded. The first of the five models to be applied by OnKai is TrialBridge. TrialBridge serves as a conduit, seamlessly linking free and available clinics with their patients to specialist centers, leveraging the role of the community in a patient's journey. This model enables patients equal access to quality care and, where possible, to clinical trials while maintaining continuity with their local clinic. This collaboration presents a promising opportunity to foster mutual benefits between Galmed, its principal sites, and the relevant clinics in underserved communities. Noam Smetana, OnKai CEO, commented, \"I am thrilled about the potential of this innovative partnership to positively impact underserved communities across the US in the coming years. We believe that our project with Galmed, along with others at various stages in our pipeline, will significantly advance health equity within the network of clinics we collaborate with.\" Allen Baharaff, CEO and President of Galmed Pharmaceuticals commented, \"We are enthusiastic about employing OnKai's groundbreaking AI technology in our trial. The application of OnKai's AI platform is still emerging but potentially disruptive for the conduct of clinical trials. Not only does this partnership allow us to include a diverse population in our trials, but it is also expected that it will result in the faster approval and better site performance.\"\n",
      "Heading: Galmed and Gannex Expand Development Programs For NASH Through Research Collaboration of Aramchol and ASC41 (THR-beta Agonist)\n",
      "Content: TEL-AVIV, Israel and SHANGHAI, Sept. 10, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- Gannex Pharma Co., Ltd., a wholly owned company of Ascletis Pharma Inc. (HKEX: 1672) and Galmed Pharmaceuticals Ltd. (NASDAQ: GLMD) announces today that they have entered into a research agreement aiming at combination therapy of ASC41 (THR-beta agonist) and Aramchol (SCD 1 inhibitor) for the treatment of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). The financial details of this transaction are not disclosed.   ASC41 is an oral thyroid hormone receptor beta (THR-beta) agonist which recently received IND approval from China's National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) to conduct clinical trials for NASH indication. Topline data of Phase I safety, PK and preliminary efficacy (LDL-C) in healthy volunteers with LDL-C > 110 mg/dL is expected to be available by the end of 2020. ASC41's active moiety selectively activates THR-beta resulting in the improvement of steatosis/lipotoxicity, inflammation, ballooning, fibrosis in both direct and indirect manner. In two NASH animal models, ASC41 demonstrated the same improvement in liver steatosis, inflammation and fibrosis at 1/10 dose of Resmetirom (MGL-3196), another THR-beta agonist currently in Phase III clinical trial. Aramchol is a novel synthetic small molecule, a conjugate of cholic acid and arachidic acid, linked by a stable amide group. Aramchol exerts its anti-steatotic and anti-fibrotic effects via inhibition of SCD 1 expression in hepatocytes and hepatic stellate cells (HSCs). In hepatocytes, reduction of SCD 1 results in elevation of AMPK, FA oxidation and Glutathione ratio. In HSC's inhibition of SCD 1 results in specific up regulation of PPAR Y which blocks collagen production. In Phase II clinical trials for NASH, Aramchol significantly reduced liver fat, improved liver histology i.e., ballooning and fibrosis, hepatic biochemistry and glycemic parameters with a favorable safety and tolerability profile. Aramchol is currently in a Phase III registrational study for NASH and fibrosis (ARMOR) and has been granted Fast Track designation status by the FDA for the treatment of NASH. \"There is a significant medical need and a large potential pharmaceutical market for NASH treatment. There are currently no drugs licensed for the treatment of NASH in US, Europe and China. ASC41 is a THR-beta agonist that improves steatosis, inflammation and fibrosis, and  Aramchol, a SCD 1 inhibitor,  reduces glycemic index and fibrosis. Therefore, combination therapy of the two drug candidates could result in synergistic effect for the treatment of NASH,\" said Dr. Jinzi J. Wu, Founder, Chairman and CEO of Ascletis. \"It is clear today that NASH is a chronic condition with multiple liver pathologies. Among all pathologies, excessive liver fat, high glycemic index and fibrosis are major treatment challenges. By combining ASC41, THR-beta agonist, which is clinically proven to rapidly reduce liver fat and improved blood lipids profile, with Aramchol, SCD 1 inhibitor, which is clinically proven to reduce glycemic index and fibrosis, physicians will have good and solid toolbox and will be able to normalize NASH patients for life and control the disease,\" said Allen Baharaff, President and CEO of Galmed. \"We believe that combining these two distinct and selective compounds with complementary mechanisms will provide a perfect treatment for NASH.\" About NASHNASH is the progressive form of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), which is characterized by the accumulation of fat in the liver, inflammation and fibrosis (scarring), and can eventually lead to cirrhosis and liver failure. NASH is a major cause of liver disease worldwide and the leading cause of liver transplants for people under 50 in the US. There are currently no approved treatments for NASH.

      "Heading: Galmed Announces Publication of Aramchol Phase IIa Trial in the Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology Journal\n",
      "Content: TEL AVIV, Israel, July 8, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- Galmed Pharmaceuticals Ltd. (Nasdaq:GLMD) (\"Galmed\") today announced the recent publication of the results of its Phase IIa clinical trial of aramchol in the peer-reviewed Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology Journal. The trial manuscript, entitled \"The Fatty Acid–Bile Acid Conjugate Aramchol Reduces Liver Fat Content in Patients with Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease,\" provides the full report of the Phase IIa trial, which was completed in January 2012 and presented at the 47th Annual Meeting of the European Association for the Study of the Liver in 2012. For the complete manuscript, please visit http://www.galmedpharma.com/for-professionals-2/publications/. In summary, the Phase IIa trial was a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of aramchol in 60 Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, or NAFLD, and Non-Alcoholic Steato-Hepatitis, or NASH, patients in 12 centers in Israel, and its study design was deemed acceptable by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, in 2007 at a pre-Investigational New Drug scientific advisory meeting.  The Phase IIa trial demonstrated that aramchol may reduce liver fat in a dose dependent manner, as evidenced by a statistically significant reduction of liver fat over a three-month treatment period of once-daily 300 mg doses of aramchol, and may induce positive trends of changes in several metabolic parameters. The trial's primary efficacy end point was a reduction in liver fat content, without consideration of inflammation or fibrosis. The secondary efficacy end points measured differences between the aramchol-treated group and the placebo group with respect to alterations of liver enzyme levels, levels of adiponectin, homeostasis model assessment scores, and endothelial function. All endpoints were met and there were no notable changes in biochemical, hematological, cardiovascular or other safety parameters, or any observable serious or drug-related adverse events in the 58 patients who completed the trial either during the three-month treatment period or during the subsequent recovery period.  Galmed further confirmed the appropriateness of a single daily dose of aramachol by pharmacokinetic analysis. Later this year, Galmed intends to begin a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging Phase IIb clinical trial of aramchol in 240 NASH patients who also suffer from obesity and insulin resistance. This planned Phase IIb clinical trial for aramchol in NASH patients is in accordance with the study design recommended by the United Kingdom's Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, deemed acceptable by Germany's Bundesinstitut fur Arzneimittel und Medizinprodukte, or BfArM, deemed satisfactory by France's Agence Nationale de Securite du Medicament et des Produits de Sante, or ANSM, and confirmed as acceptable by the FDA. BfArM and ANSM also confirmed, in minutes of each of their respective scientific advisory meetings, that if successful, this Phase IIb trial may serve as a basis for Phase III pivotal trials of aramchol. \"We believe that NAFLD and NASH are increasingly relevant public health issues, due in part to their close association with diabetes and obesity, the fact that they are a major causes of cardiovascular and liver-related morbidity and mortality, and their increasing impact on health costs in Western countries where there is a higher prevalence of these diseases,\" said Allen Baharaff, Galmed's Chief Executive Officer.\n",

      "Heading: Phase II Aramchol Clinical Trial Results\n",
      "Content: Galmed Medical Research Ltd. announced today that Phase-II randomized, double blind trial results of its novel drug Aramchol for treating Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) has successfully confirmed the novel drug’s suitability for treating this disease. The double blind, randomized placebo controlled phase-II trial was carried out in twelve medical centers in Israel. The study assessed the safety, pharmacokinetics and short-term effects of two doses of Aramchol (300 and 100 mg) in male and female patients suffering from NAFLD or NASH. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a wide spectrum of liver diseases, ranging from fatty liver (steatosis), to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and can ultimately lead to cirrhosis, or advanced scarring of the liver. NAFLD is caused by the accumulation of fat in the liver and is part of the metabolic syndrome. Aramchol, developed by Prof. Tuvia Gilat, is a novel synthetic small molecule that reduces fat in the liver by inhibiting Stearoyl-CoA desaturase1 (SCD1), a key enzyme in the metabolism of fats in the liver. Aramchol is a member of the Fatty Acid Bile Acid Conjugate (FABAC) family, which has demonstrated the ability to lower liver lipids, particularly triglycerides, in pre-established fatty liver disease in several animal species. The changes in liver fat content in 57 patients treated with the Aramchol, versus the placebo arm, were evaluated following 3 months of treatment by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (NMRS). Secondly, the study evaluated changes in serum liver enzymes, markers of endothelial dysfunction, insulin resistance and lipid levels, as well as SCD1 activity and cholesterol synthesis. Therapeutic dose response A statistically significant dose response was observed in the relative change in liver fat content between the three groups (300 mg, 100 mg, and placebo). Patients treated with 300 mg Aramchol had a significant reduction of 12.6% in liver fat content, compared to an increase of +6.4% in the placebo group and a non-significant change of -3.0% in the 100 mg group. Therapeutically positive trends were also seen in several secondary endpoints. For example, Serum adiponectin levels increased only in the high 300 mg dose Aramchol group (1.8 µg/ml) and reduced in the low dose (-3.4 µg/ml ) and placebo groups (-7.1 µg/ml). Endothelial function increased by 63% in the high 300 mg dose group, by 23% in the low 100 mg dose group and by 34% in the placebo group. In patients receiving 300 mg there were non-significant reductions in serum ALT, HOMA, insulin levels and body weight, while no such changes were observed in the 100 mg or placebo groups. No significant difference between the three groups was observed in reduction of serum levels of cholesterol, triglyceride and HbA1c levels. Detailed results will be presented for the first time at the International Liver Congress EASL 2012, in Barcelona, Spain, April 18-22, 2012. Demonstrated safety No severe drug related adverse events (“AE”) were observed during the 3-month treatment period and subsequent recovery period. Adverse events were mild or moderate and transient, and did not differ between the groups. No patient discontinued treatment due to AEs. Once daily dosage suitability Pharmacokinetics studies confirmed Aramchol’s suitability for once daily oral administration. The study demonstrated dose proportional increases in plasma levels with constant steady state levels throughout the study period and a long elimination half-life. “NAFLD is prevalent among the western population and affects at least 100 million people in the US. This disease may advance to chronic liver disease and is associated with metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. There are currently no efficient medical treatments to solve this major public health problem. These very encouraging clinical study results confirm that Aramchol is a suitable candidate for this purpose,” said Prof. Ran Oren from Hadassah Medical Center, Principal Investigator for the study. About Fatty Liver Disease NAFLD refers to a wide spectrum of liver disease ranging from fatty liver (steatosis), to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), to cirrhosis (advanced scarring of the liver). In recent years, NAFLD emerged as the world’s most common liver disease and a major contributing factor of Chronic Liver Disease (CLD), one of the major causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. It is estimated that NAFLD affects up to 33 percent of adults and over 5 percent of children. The prevalence of NASH is between 4 and 6 percent of the general population. The prevalence of NAFLD and NASH is rising rapidly across the globe, in parallel with obesity and diabetes. It is estimated that about two-thirds of obese adults and one-half of obese children may suffer from NAFLD.

      "Content: TEL AVIV, Israel, April 28, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- Galmed Pharmaceuticals Ltd. (\"Galmed\"), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of a once-daily, oral therapy for the treatment of liver diseases and cholesterol gallstones, announced today that it commenced patient screening for pharmacokinetic, or PK, and food effect studies of aramchol. In written correspondence regarding a requested pre-Investigational New Drug application meeting, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration recommended that Galmed conduct such studies prior to commencing its planned Phase IIb clinical trial of aramchol for the treatment of Non-Alcoholic Steato-Hepatitis, or NASH, in obese patients with insulin resistance.  Galmed will conduct the study at the Sourasky Medical Center in Tel Aviv, Israel with Dr. Jacob Atzmon as its principal investigator. The studies are designed for the enrollment of 66 healthy male volunteers who will receive the same two doses of aramchol that Galmed proposes to use in its planned Phase IIb clinical trial. Galmed expects the studies to also provide additional safety data to further support existing safety data from its prior pre-clinical studies and Phase I and Phase IIa clinical trials of aramchol. Galmed anticipates completing the studies by the end of the third quarter of this year. Following the completion of the PK and food effect studies, Galmed currently plans to initiate its Phase IIb clinical trial of aramchol in Europe and Israel in the fourth quarter of this year.\n",
      "Heading: Recently Published Independent Research Supports the Importance of Reverse Cholesterol Transport on NASH Pathogenesis\n",
      "Content: TEL AVIV, Israel, June 4, 2014 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Galmed Pharmaceuticals Ltd. (GLMD) (\"Galmed\"), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of a once-daily, oral therapy for the treatment of liver diseases and cholesterol gallstones, announced today that recently published data in the April 2014 issue of Biochimie supports the importance of the regulation of ABCA1-induced reverse cholesterol transport on the pathogenesis of Non-Alcoholic Steato-Hepatitis, or NASH. ABCA1 is an enzyme that induces \"reverse cholesterol transport,\" which is essential for maintaining cholesterol balance in the body. Excess levels of \"bad\" cholesterol are deposited mainly in vascular walls, causing atherosclerosis, or a vascular disease in which an artery wall thickens as a result of the accumulation of calcium and fatty materials. Activation of the reverse cholesterol transport beneficially reduces the bad cholesterol deposited in vascular walls and mediates the elimination of cholesterol from cells through \"good\" cholesterol. The recently published pre-clinical data suggests that an increase in ABCA1 activity in mice may not only lead to a reduction in \"bad\" cholesterol levels through reverse cholesterol transport, but also a reduction in liver fat content, both of which Galmed believes to be important factors in the pathogenesis of NASH. Galmed's product candidate, aramchol, has been shown in independent studies to increase ABCA1 activity in experimental animal models by between 300% and 400%. This data was published in Biochemical Journal, the Archives of Medical Research and the Current Opinion in Lipidology in 2006, 2010 and 2010, respectively,\n",

Dividends distributed to non-Israeli resident corporate shareholders that hold at least 90% (directly, or under certain conditions, indirectly) of Galmed R&D shares, would be generally subject to a withholding tax at a rate of up to 4%, and at a rate of up to 20% if otherwise. \"We are thrilled to have been approved for \"Preferred Technological Enterprise\" status\", said Yohai Stenzler, CFO. \"The new status presents an opportunity to greatly reduce potential future tax liabilities and therefore may create meaningful additional value as we consider alternatives including global licensing and collaboration opportunities.\" The tax ruling applies for five years until 2022 and may be extended for further periods subject to meeting certain requirements. About Aramchol™ and Non-alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH)\n",
      "Aramchol™ (arachidyl amido cholanoic acid) is a novel fatty acid bile acid conjugate, inducing beneficial modulation of intra-hepatic lipid metabolism. Aramchol™'s ability to modulate hepatic lipid metabolism was discovered and validated in animal models, demonstrating down regulation of the three key pathologies of NASH: steatosis, inflammation and fibrosis. The effect of Aramchol™ on fibrosis is mediated by down regulation of steatosis and directly on human collagen producing cells. Aramchol™ has been granted Fast Track designation status by the FDA for the treatment of NASH. NASH is an emerging world crisis impacting an estimated 3% to 5% of the U.S. population and an estimated 2% to 4% globally. It is the fastest growing cause of liver cancer and liver transplant in the U.S. due to the rise in obesity. NASH is the progressive form of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease that can lead to cardiovascular disease, cirrhosis and liver-related mortality.\n",
